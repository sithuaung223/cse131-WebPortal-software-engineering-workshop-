<H3>Studio</H3>

Review <a href="../../StudioDocs/studioheader.html">studio procedures</a> before
starting.
<HR>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>
Feel free to participate in a different group than last time. This is totally
up to you, but try to find a group that makes it easy for you to participate.
<p>
Be careful how you use the web.  You are required to develop solutions
as a group by thinking not by finding solutions that have been thought
out by others.  You must be able to explain anything that you have done.

<H3>Warmup</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
First, form a group:
<UL>
 <LI> If you are at a table with a large, wall-mounted screens, a group of 3-4 people is fine.
 <LI> If you are seated at a table without a large screen, a group of 2 people is better.
</UL>
<LI> All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along
and see the instructions as you work.
<LI> All members of the group should update their repositories:
<UL>
  <LI> Open your repository in eclipse
  <LI> Right-click (control-click on a mac) on your repository name
  <LI> Drag down to <KBD>Team...</KBD>
  <LI> Choose <KBD>Update</KBD>
  <LI> Supply your WUSTL key and password as necessary
</UL>
<LI> Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work.  Initially,
one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
<LI> Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.  Before doing so,
<B>commit your work</B> to make sure your work is saved.
</UL>

<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Two problems follow.  First pick the one of greatest interest to your group,
and try to finish that one.  If you have time, then try the other one.

<H3>Problem 1:  Determining the GC content of DNA</H3>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> 
is comprised of two long polymers (often called strands) of <I>nucleotides</I>.  Each nucleotide
is commonly one of four possible <I>bases</I> denoted by a single character:
A, T, C, or G.
<p>
An organism's DNA, once determined, is often represented as a string 
whose characters that represent a portion of one strand of the DNA. 
<p>
One property of interest to biologist is the GC content of DNA:  what fraction
of an organism's DNA are the bases G or C?
<p>
In this studio, your team should do the following:
<OL>
  <LI> With your repository open, create a <KBD>GC</KBD> class in the
<KBD>studio2</KBD> package.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be sure to check the box that generates <KBD>public static void main</KBD>. 
Otherwise you will have to type that by hand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <LI> Your first task is to generate a random string of DNA, as follows:
 <OL>
   <LI> Prompt the user to supply an integer that will be the length of the
string you will generate.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you don't remember how to do this, look at code from a previous
studio or lab.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> Use iteration, conditionals, and the random-number generator to 
generate a random <KBD>String</KBD> of DNA.
   <LI> Print that string so we can see it.
 </OL>
  <LI> Run the <KBD>CG</KBD> program several times.  Check the output to make sure
it looks reasonable in terms of the length and contents.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You should ensure that your code works properly for <I>edge cases</I>.  For
example, what happens if the user specifies <KBD>0</KBD> as the desired
length?
<p>
Also, because you are using the random-number generator, your output should
look different among different runs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Now let's compute the CG content of your generated DNA.
<OL>
  <LI> Just after you have printed the DNA, write a loop that computes
     how many bases in the DNA string are <KBD>C</KBD> or <KBD>G</KBD>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some notes:
<UL>
  <LI> Case matters.  A <KBD>G</KBD> and a <KBD>g</KBD> are two different
characters.  Be sure you are looking for the proper case.
  <LI> If you have a <KBD>String</KBD>&nbsp;</KBD>s</KBD>, then the
caracter at position <I>i</I> can be gotten by:
<PRE>
  char r = s.charAt(i);
</PRE>
<LI>
Note that the first chracter in <KBD>s</KBD> occurs at location <KBD>0</KBD>.
If <KBD>s</KBD> has <KBD>n</KBD> characters, then its last character
occurs at location <KBD>n-1</KBD>.
  <LI> To compare <KBD>r</KBD> to a character constant, surround that
character constant with single quotes, as in:
<PRE>
   if (r == 'G') {
      System.out.println("I saw a G.");
   }
</PRE>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE
</OL>
  <LI> Print an informative message that shows the fraction or percent of
the generated DNA that is <KBD>G</KBD> or <KBD>C</KBD>.
<LI> Go back and change the probabilities of generating the four specific
bases, so that you are more likely to generate <KBD>G</KBD> or <KBD>C</KBD>
than <KBD>A</KBD> or <KBD>T</KBD>.
  <LI> Rerun your program and see if your analysis confirms that the 
distribution was suitably affected.
</OL>

<H3> Problem 2:  Computing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> by throwing darts</H3>
<p>
Computer scientists often use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">simulation</a> as a means of
modeling, understanding, and predicting real-world phenomena.
<p>
Your group is auditioning 
for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_%28TV_series%29"> Survivor</a>
by proving your group's ability to compute 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> using
only the materials at hand, as follows:
<UL>
  <LI> A unit-square dart board (say, 1 meter by 1 meter).  Unit-square
   dart boards are astoundingly resilient in plane crashes,
   and yours is nicely intact.
  <LI> Some darts, suitable for throwing at the dart board.
  <LI> A string and a stylus, standard safety-kit issue, suitable for 
     inscribing a unit circle in your unit-square dartboard.
  <LI> A dart-throwing expert.  However, since the plane crash, the
      expert is left with the (uncanny) ability to throw darts that always land
      somewhere, uniformly and randomly, within the unit-square dart board.
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      While the thrower never misses the unit square, the darts 
      land sometimes within the inscribed circle, sometimes not.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI> 
As a group, develop an approach for computing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> based on the above
materials.  
<LI> Implement your approach using iteration.
You can start with the following
<a href="Studio/Pi.java">Pi.java</a> file that you can paste into a new
Java class in one of your lab projects.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This may be the first new Class you have developed, but eclipse makes
it easy:
<UL>
 <LI> Right-click on the package name in which you want to define the
    new class.  In this case, use <KBD>studio2</KBD>.
 <LI> Click <KBD>New...</KBD>
 <LI> Choose <KBD>Class<KBD>
 <LI> Pick the name <KBD>Pi</KBD> for this class, since the code you
    will paste is for class <KBD>Pi</KBD>.
 <B> Java style dictates that its classes should begin with a capital letter!</B>
 <LI> When the editor opens for your new class, copy and paste
the code from 
<a href="Studio/Pi.java">Pi.java</a> into the class.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
You will need to simulate a random dart thrower.  The function
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random()"><KBD>math.random()</KBD></a> will help, 
as it returns a nonnegative <KBD>double</KBD>
less than 1.0.
You may also find the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt(double)"><KBD>Math.sqrt()</KBD></a> function
to be helpful.
<LI> Investigate and discuss how well your
technique computes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a>.
</OL>
<HR>
<H3>Further investigations</H3>
<P>
If you have time,
pick one or both of the following:
<OL>
<LI> Investigate the fairness of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random()"><KBD>math.random()</KBD></a> method.
<OL>
  <LI> What normative criteria should a random number possess?
  <LI> How can you measure the fairness of a random number generator?
  <LI> Implement some tests and discuss your results amongst yourselves and
       other groups.
</OL>
<LI> There are other ways of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi"> computing  Pi</a>.
Try some of these and study their effectiveness in terms of the number of
iterations you use.
</OL>

<HR>
<H2>Submitting your work (read carefully)</H2>
<UL>
<LI> If your studio contains a <KBD>feedback.txt</KBD> file, respond to
the questions and supply any requested information.
<LI> You must commit all of your work to your repository.  It's best to do this
from the top-most level of your repository, which bears your name and student ID.
<LI> Follow the instructions in the green box below to receive credit for your work.
</UL>
