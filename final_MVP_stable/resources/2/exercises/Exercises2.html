<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>N runs of the 10 heads problem</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the second of three exercises in which you take the program 
developed in the round table video and modify it to compute
more interesting results.

<UL>
  <LI> Continue modifying the <KBD>Heads</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises2</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> Instead of running the experiment 100 times, prompt the user for
a value <KBD>N</KBD> and run the experiment <KBD>N</KBD> times.

<H3>Convert inches to feet</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>FeetInches</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises2</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> Prompt the user for some number of inches.
  <LI> Produce output that corresponds the number of feet and any leftover
       inches when converted from the specified input.
  <LI> Be sure your output:
<UL>
  <LI> Uses the word <KBD>feet</KBD> for plural and <KBD>foot<KBD> for 
singular number of feet.
  <LI> Uses the word <KBD>inches</KBD> for plural and <KBD>inch<KBD> for 
singular number of feet.
</UL>
For example:
<UL>
  <LI> 13 inches will produce:  1 foot and 1 inch
  <LI> 17 inches will produce:  1 foot and 5 inches
  <LI> 28 inches will produce:  2 feet and 4 inches
