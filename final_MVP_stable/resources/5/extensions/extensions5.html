<H3>Refactoring</H3>
<p>
To earn the points for this extension, go back to a lab or extension
you have previously completed, and refactor it using methods to eliminate
code duplication.
<p>
To demo:
<UL>
  <LI> Make sure your refactored code still works.
  <LI> Commit the refactored version.
  <LI> To show your work to a TA, right (control) click on the file
name in eclipse package explorer, then choose <KBD>Compare with...</KBD>.
choose <KBD>Revision or URL</KBD>. In the pop up box, choose
<KBD> Revision:</KBD> and hit <KBD>browse</KBD>.  Pick a revision that
shows your work prior to refactoring.   Eclipse will display both files side by side so your TA can marvel at your refactoring.

<H2>Extension 2: Chase, The Mouse (5 points):</H2><p>
<DL><DT>Authors<DD><UL>
  <LI> Arman Guerra
</UL></DL>
<H3>A Story</H3>
<p>
Chase, the Mouse, was standing still on the Standard Draw template one day, thinking about the meaning of 
life. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, a ball began to follow Chase. No matter where Chase went the ball would follow and pester Chase until he moved again. 
You will be writing the code for the ball.
<p>
<H4>Procedure</H4>
Create a <KBD>FollowTheMouse</KBD> class in the <KBD>mousefollower</KBD> package. You will have to write a few specific methods for this extension. 
You can test those with the JUnit test provided in the package.
Once all of these methods are written, you will put them to use in 
the main method to create a Standard Draw template in which a ball follows your mouse. The methods that you must write are:

<DL>
  <DT> <KBD>double[] getMousePosition()</KBD> 
  <DD> This method returns an array of two <KBD>doubles</KBD>, the x and y coordinates of the mouse. You can find the coordinates 
  of the mouse on the standard canvas using <KBD>StdDraw.mouseX()</KBD> and <KBD>StdDraw.mouseY()</KBD>
   <OL>
      <LI> Write that method so that the first <KBD>double</KBD> in the array that you return is the x coordinate of the mouse, and the second <KBD>double</KBD> is 
      the y coordinate of the mouse. 
       <BLOCKQUOTE>
      This method should be very simple.
       </BLOCKQUOTE>
       <LI> Test this method using the JUnit test <KBD>GetMousePositionTest</KBD> in the <KBD>mousefollower</KBD> class. When you run this test, a ball will appear
        on a Standard Draw template. Try to follow the ball with your mouse while the test runs.
   </OL>
  <DT> <KBD>drawBall(double[] position, double radius)</KBD> 
  <DD>This Method draws the ball wherever it should be in a specific frame. 
	 <OL> 	
  		<LI> This should take in an array of 2 <KBD>doubles</KBD> that specifies the x and y coordinates of the ball and a <KBD>double</KBD> for the radius.
  		<LI> Test this by manually drawing a ball in your main method at a specific x and y coordinate. You can use the following code:
  		  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  		  
  		  <KBD>
  		  double[] tester = new double[]{.5, .5};
		  drawBall(tester, .2);
	 	  StdDraw.show(2000);
	 	  </KBD>
	 	  <br>
	 	  If this draws a large ball in the middle of your template, then your <KBD>drawBall()</KBD> method works!
	 	  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  	</OL>
  <DT> <KBD>double[] changePosition(double[] position, double[] mousePosition, double speed)</KBD> 
  <DD> This should return an array of 2 <KBD>doubles</KBD> that represents the new position of the ball
   <OL> 	
  		<LI>This method takes in an array of 2 <KBD>doubles</KBD> that specifies the original position of the ball, an array of 2 <KBD>doubles</KBD> that 
  		specifies the mouse position, and a <KBD>double</KBD> for the speed. 
  		<BLOCKQUOTE>
  		 You are not simply drawing a ball at the position of the mouse. The ball should move at a constant speed towards the mouse at all times.
  		  This will require some basic geometry. However, you will not need to use any trigonometric functions. 
 		
		<IMG SRC="Extensions/SimilairTriangles.png" width = 400>
		
		
		dx and dy are the distances from the ball to the mouse. The legs of the green triangle represent the x and y components of the distance the ball moves
		in each frame. The hypotenuse of the green triangle represents the total distance the ball moves in each frame. This is, effectively, the "speed" of the ball,
		 distance per frame. 
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
   </OL>
</DL>   
 
 Finally, make sure to implement all of these methods in the <KBD>main</KBD> method inside of a <KBD>while</KBD> loop, along with the other 
 necessary <KBD>StdDraw</KBD> code. It would be helpful to set the initial position of the ball outside of the <KBD>while</KBD> loop, and then alter it inside. 
 
 
 <H4>To Demo:</H4>
 
 You must be able to pass the unit tests, and you should have a ball follow your mouse

<H2>Extension 3: Build Your Own Calculator! (5 points):</H2><p>
<DL><DT>Authors<DD><UL>
  <LI> Arman Guerra
</UL></DL>
<H3>A How-To Guide</H3>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this extension you shall complete the functionality of a calculator. You accomplish this by creating a series of methods that 
use the arithmetic, <KBD>String</KBD>, <KBD>boolean</KBD>, and casting operations. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>In eclipse, open the <KBD>calculator</KBD> package found in
the <KBD>extensions</KBD> source folder.
<LI> You will find the following Java files:
<DL>
  <DT> <KBD>Computations</KBD> <DD>This is where you will be writing your code. 
  <DT> <KBD>Calculator</KBD>  <DD>This is what you will run when you are finished writing all of your methods. This class creates a GUI, 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a>. This is what you see when you run <KBD>Calculator</KBD>, an 
  interface that allows the user to interact with the code. <KBD>Calculator</KBD> will not run until you are finished writing all of your methods, so 
  if you want to check your code, use the unit test provided.
   <DT> <KBD>ComputationsTest</KBD> <DD>This is the unit test for this extension. Your code must pass this test for you to earn credit. You can check your methods with 
   test as you go. We recommend that you check intermittently to see if you are writing your code correctly, so that if you're making a mistake, you 
   can catch yourself early.
</DL>
</UL>

<H4>Procedure</H4>

You will be writing two kinds of methods. The first kind will be the operational methods, which take in two parameters, and return the result of 
some operation. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// Returns the result of adding d1 and d2.
public static double addDoubles(double d1, double d2) {
	return d1 + d2;
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The second kind of method will be <EM>to</EM> methods, which take in some value, and cast it to the necessary type. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// takes in an int and returns a double
public static double intToDouble(int in) {
	return (double)in;
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If the input makes no sense, <EM>throw</EM> an exception. For example, if someone inputs a <KBD>String</KBD>, converting it to an <KBD>int</KBD> would make no sense. 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
So for the method 
 <PRE>
 public static int stringToInt(String in) {
	throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}  
</PRE>
<p> 
you would <EM>throw</EM> an exception that indicates that this operation is unsupported.
 When you <EM>throw</EM> this exception, our code <EM>catches</EM> the exception, and sends out an error message through the GUI.
You will learn more about this in future classes. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Methods</H4>
First you will write:
<UL>
<LI> Double operations, which take in two doubles and output one double:
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>double addDoubles(double d1, double d2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double subtractDoubles(double d1, double d2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double divideDoubles(double d1, double d2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double multiplyDoubles(double d1, double d2)</KBD>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Make sure that the calculator will not crash if a user tells it to divide by zero. If a user tries to divide by zero, return zero.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
At ths point, and at each subsequent point of arrival, run the unit
test to see if the changes you have made so far pass the test.  At this
point, the <KBD>double</KBD> tests should pass.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Integer operations, which take in two integers, and output one
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>int addInts(int i1, int i2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int subtractInts(int i1, int i2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int divideInts(int i1, int i2)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int multiplyInts(int i1, int i2)</KBD>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Again, there is a possibility that a user will divide by zero here. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YneYiO1r0Ow"> Do the thing</a> detailed above. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> A String Operation, which takes in two Strings and concatenates them
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>String concatenate(String s1, String s2)</KBD>
</UL>
<LI> Boolean operations, which take in two booleans and outputs one
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>boolean andBoolean(boolean b1, boolean b2)</KBD> which returns the value of the expression <KBD>b1 &amp;&amp; b2</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>boolean orBoolean(boolean b1, boolean b2)</KBD> which returns the value of the expression <KBD>b1 || b2</KBD>
</UL>
</UL>

Then you will write: 
<UL>
<LI> Double <EM>to</EM> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a double when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>double intToDouble(int in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double doubleToDouble(double in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double stringToDouble(String in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>double booleanToDouble(boolean in)</KBD>
</UL>
<LI> Integer <EM>to</EM> methods, which take in a value and convert it to an integer when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>int intToInt(int in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int doubleToInt(double in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int stringToInt(String in))</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>int booleanToInt(boolean in)</KBD>
</UL> 
<LI> String <EM>to</EM> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a String when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>String intToString(int in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>String doubleToString(double in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>String stringToString(String in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>String booleanToString(boolean in)</KBD>
</UL>
<LI> Boolean <EM>to</EM> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a boolean when it makes sense, and throw and error if it doesn't make sense.
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>boolean intToBoolean(int in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>boolean doubleToBoolean(double in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>boolean stringToBoolean(String in)</KBD>
<LI> <KBD>boolean booleanToBoolean(boolean in)</KBD>
</UL>
</UL>
Each of these methods should be quite short.


<H4> To Demo </H4>
You must pass all of the unit tests, and your calculator should work properly

<H2>Extension 4: Watermelon Puzzle (8 points):</H2><p>
<DL><DT>Authors<DD><UL>
  <LI> Arman Guerra
</UL></DL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Adapted from <I>Sit and Solve Brainteasers</I> by Derick Niederman
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H4> Warm Up </H4>
Five watermelons, each of different weight, have been weighed in <i>pairs</I>
to obtain the following weights:
<p>
<CENTER><B>
20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31
</B></CENTER>
<p>

One way to solve this would be to figure out a mathematical algorithm for this number of watermelons and work out the weight of each watermelon. 
Another would be to try all of the possible combinations of weights five watermelons until you found one that has this same set of combinations of weights.
Either way you did it, the specific set of watermelons that produces these weights is
<p>
<CENTER><B>
 [ 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 ]
</B></CENTER>
<p>

<H4> Procedure </H4> 
Since we have computers, and know how to write code, trying all of the possible weights of the five watermelons is now much easier. In this extension, 
you will take in an array of 10 weights, and you will try, iteratively, to come up with the individual weights of the five watermelons.

<OL>
<LI>
Find the code for this extension in the <KBD>watermelons</KBD> package.
<LI> Create two methods in the <KBD>Watermelons</KBD> class. There is one finished method that will help you write the other two 
methods. The two methods you must create are:
<DL>
 <DT> <KBD>int[] allPairSums(int[] nums)
 <DD> This method must be completed first.  Given the input array
<KBD>nums</KBD>, this method computes the pairwise-sum of each distinct
pair of index values for that array.  For example, given the
input <KBD>{40, 20, 10, 30}</KBD>, the method must compute the sums of
indices 
<KBD>(0,1)</KBD>,
<KBD>(0,2)</KBD>,
<KBD>(0,3)</KBD>,
<KBD>(1,2)</KBD>,
<KBD>(1,3)</KBD>,
<KBD>(2,3)</KBD>, returning the array
<CENTER>
<KBD>{60, 50, 70, 30, 50, 40}</KBD>
</CENTER>
The ordering of the elements in the returned array does not matter.
<DT> <KBD>int[] getSolution(int[] originalSums)</KBD>
<DD> This method returns a solution to the puzzle for the array of 10 integers that are passed into it. The ordering of elements
in the array you produce does not matter, as far as the provided unit test is concerned. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The included method, <KBD>boolean sameIntArrays(int[] one, int[] two)</KBD> 
will help you with this method. When you pass two integer arrays into <KBD>sameIntArrays</KBD>, it checks whether the two integer arrays contain the same elements.
The order of the elements in the arrays does not matter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<LI> Make sure you pass the provided unit tests.  Once it does, you will
have a solution to the puzzle.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For extra fun, go into the code for the Unit test, and inside the <KBD>int[] genSolution()</KBD> method, uncomment <KBD>List<Integer> ans = genIntsSlow();</KBD>
and comment out <KBD>List<Integer> ans = genIntsFast();</KBD>. This will pass larger weights into your <KBD>int[] getSolution(int[] originalSums)</KBD> method, 
and so the computation will take longer. It could take up to a minute. This is not required, but it is a neat example of a very large computation.

<H4>Introduction</H4>
The design of software can often be specified using its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>, or Application Programming Interface.  The API specifies the
<i>methods</I> that are offered by the software.  Documentation for those
methods typically includes:
<UL>
  <LI> the <i>signature</I> of each method:
<UL>
 <LI> the method's name
 <LI> the types of the method's parameters
 <LI> the return type (or <KBD>void</KBD>) for the method
</UL>
<LI>  the documentation for the method

The above should be sufficient to use the software, but it can also form

<H4>Description</H4> 
In this extension you complete the first step towards creating slots, the classic casino game. In this game, you pull a lever and the slots rotate, slow down, and eventually land
on some combination. Based on the combination you have the chance to win a certain amount of money. You will create this machine using 
<kbd>StdDraw</kbd>. 
<H4>Procedure</H4> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You are only taking a step towards completing slots, so read the instructions carefully so that you do not do more than you need to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This step in your implementation of the slots machine must include:
<UL>
<LI> Some sort of drawing of the slots machine. Get creative here! There is a lot you can do with <kbd>StdDraw</kbd>.
<LI> Three rotating wheels with shapes on them. The shapes must move from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen, or vice-versa. You can use any shapes you would
like. 
</UL>
A couple of methods that might be helpful in your implementation are:
<UL>
<LI> Some sort of <kbd>drawShapes()</kbd> method that takes in some description of the state of a shape or a slot and draws it
<LI> A <kbd>moveShapes()</kbd> method that moves the shapes with the desired velocity in some direction.
<LI> And, of course, a <kbd>main()</kbd> method to run your loop.
</UL>
You can add more or fewer methods, depending on how you want your implementation to work, but having these will save you a lot of code writing.

<H4>Description</H4> 
In this extension you complete the second step towards creating slots, the classic casino game. In this game, you pull a lever, and the slots rotate, slow down, and eventually land
on some combination. Based on the combination you have the chance to win a certain amount of money. You will create this machine using 
<kbd>StdDraw</kbd>. 

<H4>Procedure</H4> 
This step in your implementation of the slots machine must include:
<UL>
<LI> You can decide: either the slots will slow down and then eventually come
 to a stop on a random shape, or the user will click, and the shapes will stop.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Either way, when a slot stops on a shape that shape must appear in the center of the slot, so that the user can tell which shape the slot landed on
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> When the slots stop, you should print a message telling the user whether or not any points were scored. If the user hit the Jackpot, congratulations are in order. If not, 
inform the user of this with a morose message, such as "you stink" or  <a href="https://youtu.be/S3I5XcsReT0?t=10s">this</a> (right click this link, and open it in a new tab)

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 You can write text using <kbd>StdDraw.text(double xCoord, double yCoord, String string)</kbd>. If you want to set the font, create a new font and then set that as
 the font 
 <PRE>
 	Font f = new Font("Tahoma", Font.PLAIN, 50);
 	
	StdDraw.setFont(f);
</PRE>
<kbd>Tahoma</kbd> is the name of the font, <kbd>Font.plain</kbd> is the style, and <kbd>50</kbd> is the size of the font. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> You should keep the score of the game and display it every time the slots stop. The score should go up every time the user gets 2 or 3 of a kind, and go down otherwise. 
<LI> Once you display to the user the outcome of the spin, the user should be able to click on the standard draw canvas, and the Jackpot machine should run again.
If you would like to create a button you can, but it is not required, as long as clicking somehow restarts the animation. 
</UL>
A couple of methods that you might add when you modify your Jackpot machine:
<UL>
<LI> a <kbd>checkStop()</kbd> or <kbd>slowDown</kbd> method that stops the slot when the mouse is pressed or slows it down, depending on your implementation

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are going to check if the user clicked to stop the slot, check in your <kbd>main()</kbd> method, and pass the coordinates of the mouse
 (using <kbd>StdDraw.mouseX()</kbd> and <kbd>StdDraw.mouseY()</kbd>) into the method that decides which slot will stop, as opposed to finding the coordinates of the mouse 
 in the method that you call. There is a tiny widow of time in which the user could move the mouse out of the way, which could cause you to stop the wrong slot.
</BLOCKQUOTE> 

<LI> one or more methods that draw the screen that appears when the slots stop that show the score and write out whether or not the user won anything
<LI> a <kbd>checkIfFinished()</kbd> method that returns whether or not all of the slots have stopped moving. 
</UL>
You can have more or fewer methods, depending on how you want your implementation to work, but having these will save you a lot of code writing.

<H4> Procedure </H4> 
<p>Your goal in this extension is to create a memory matching game using <kbd>StdDraw</kbd> and your growing computer science knowledge. If
you've never played a memory matching game before, you can find a Thomas the Tank Engine themed one <a href="http://www.sproutonline.com/games/thomas-memory-match"> here </a>
to get the general idea. </p> 

<p>In this extension, you are going to create a matching game that uses colors rather than images. It should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Generate a 4-by-4 grid of clearly distinguishable tiles (you can change your design to accommodate any even number of tiles if you want, but 4x4 is the
base requirement).
<li> The board should be made up of randomly distributed pairs of colored tiles (8 in total); all of these colors are initially hidden. You are welcome to choose
 the colors yourself, or come up with some way of auto-generating them. Note that the distribution of colored tiles on the board should change from 
 game to game, but the actual colors need not.
<li> Tiles should start out blank and should reveal their concealed color when clicked. When a single tile is clicked, it will remain visible until
a second is selected. If that second selected tile does not conceal the same color as the first tile then, after a reasonable delay, both tiles should 
revert to blank. If the second tile is the same color as the first tile, then both these tiles should stay flipped. You get to decide what eight colors 
are hidden in the game board, but they should be easily distinguishable from each other.
<li> The game must keep track of score. You can do this by either timing the game, or counting the number clicks it takes before the full board is revealed.
Once the game is over, the score should be displayed on the <kbd>StdDraw</kbd> canvas somewhere.
<li> After the game is over, a single click to the StdDraw canvas should start a new game (the player shouldn't need to re-run the program to play
again).
</ul>
<blockquote>
Be aware that the <kbd>(0,0)</kbd> coordinate on the <kbd>StdDraw</kbd> canvas is in the <em>lower</em>-left corner while the 
<kbd>[0][0]</kbd> index of a double array is in the <em>upper</em>-left. If you store information is arrays, you want to have consistency between the 
way that information is stored and viewed. You can do this however you like, but it's recommended that you change the scale of the 
<kbd>StdDraw</kbd> canvas so that its coordinates match those of the double array.
</blockquote>

<p>In order to make this task easier for yourself, you should break the game up into parts and use several methods. Maybe you start out by creating a method
to randomly generate the board of colors, then a method to draw the board, then then move on to the game itself.</p>

<p>In this extension, you are going to need while loops that will run indefinitely, waiting for some input from the player. You 
<em>must</em> use the <kbd>StdDraw.pause(int msec)</kbd> method to give your computer a break. If you don't, the computer will waste 
resources doing absolutely nothing. Below is some sample code to demonstrate what this looks like:</p>
<pre>
while(true) {
	if(StdDraw.mousePressed()) {
		// Do something...
	}
	StdDraw.pause(80);
}
</pre>

<blockquote>
Don't forget that in order to actually run you game you will need a <kbd>main</kbd> method.

<H2>Extension 9: Net Present Value (3 points):</H2><p>

  <LI> Alan Waldman
  <LI> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">Wikipedia</a>

<H4>Present Value</H4>
In this assignment, we consider and reason about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a>.  
This is based on the observations:
<UL>
<LI>
While we live in the present, we understand the value of
$1 in terms of what it can buy today.  
<LI> It's difficult for us to think of what a dollar
could buy 100 years ago, or 100 years from now.
<LI> If we want to compare monetary values from several time periods,
it is helpful to view them in the same time period.
</UL>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The suggestion is therefore to reason about all currency in <I>today's dollars</I>.  This is called <i>present value</I>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The ideas discussed here are widely used in economics, finanace, and
accounting.
<H4>Two Friends and your $1</H4>
Suppose you have $1 and two friends who offer to take your dollar under the
following circumstances:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=10>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<B>Friend One</B>
<p>
This friend takes your $1 and gives you back $5 tomorrow.
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<B>Friend Two</B>
<p>
This friend takes your $1 and gives you back $10 in fifty years.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Which friend is offering you the better deal?  
<UL>
 <LI> If we consider only the number of dollars you receive from these
two friends, then in 50 years you end up with either $5, or $10.
<LI> It may therefore seem that Friend Two is offering you the better deal.
<LI> However, we know that $10 fifty years from now is not worth $10 today.
</UL>
<p>
How do we reason about the value of $10 in fifty years?  We must first model
how the value of money changes over time.  We do this by choosing:
<UL>
  <LI> a time period during which the money's value stays the same, and at the
end of which money grows instantaneously by some factor <I>r</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For this exercise, we choose a year's time, so that money changes
value annually.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> the factor <I>r</I>, which is interchangeably called
the <I>discount rate</I>, <I>opportunity cost of capital</I>, and
<I>rate of return</I>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>For this exercise, we choose 10% growth so that 
<I>r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1</I>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<p>
We
then use the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a> 
to compute the following:
<UL>
  <LI> What would $1 be worth in fifty years if invested with some
rate of return <I>r</I>?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We model this computation by the function
<PRE>
futureValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars &times; (1.0 + r)<sup>years</sup>
</PRE>
<p>
Thus, $1 is the same now as $117 dollars fifty years from now.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> How much would I have to set aside today so that it would be worth
$1 in fifty years using the discount
rate <I>r</I>?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We model this computation by computing the reverse (running time backwards)
of what we computed for the future:
<PRE>
presentValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars / (1.0 + r)<sup>years</sup>
</PRE>
<p>
Thus, to have $1 fifty years from now, we would have to set aside
0.854 cents (less than one cent) now.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<p>
Returning to your two friends, let's relate both friends' offers in terms
of present value, and compute your profit or loss (your <I>net</I> result).
<H4>Net Present Value</H4>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=10>
<TR> <TD COLSPAN=2 ALIGN=CENTER>
Recall we assume a discount rate of 10% (<KBD>r=0.10</KBD>) and we regard
time annually.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<B>Friend One</B>
<UL>
<LI>
This friend takes your $1 and gives you back $5 tomorrow.  
<LI> With money changing
value annually, $5 tomorrow is the same as $5 today.  
<LI>Computing
<PRE>presentValue($5, 0, 0.10) = $5 / (1.0 + 0.10)<sup>0</sup></PRE> yields $5.
<LI>
This friend's offer is therefore worth $5 today. 
<LI> Your <I>net</I> gain is
the $5 you receive <I>minus</I> the $1 you gave away, so you net $4.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because your <I>net present value</I> from this deal is positive ($5), you would choose
to take advantage of this friend's offer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<B>Friend Two</B>
<UL>
<LI>
This friend takes your $1 and gives you back $10 in a fifty years.
<LI> $10 in fifty years sounds better than $5 tomorrow, but &hellip;
<LI>
Computing <PRE>presentValue($10, 50, 0.10) = $10 / (1.0 + 0.10)<sup>50</sup></PRE> 
tell us that this friend's
offer is worth about 8 cents today.  
<LI> Your <I>net</i> gain is the 0.08 dollars
you receive minus the $1 you gave away, so you net &minus;0.92 dollars.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because your <I>net present value</I> is negative (&minus;0.92), you would decline
this friend's offer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<H4>Product Development Story</H4>

Consider the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value#Example">example from Wikipedia</a>,
based on investing $100,000 to create a new product:
<UL>
 <LI> The product would cost you $100,000 to develop.  That money would be gone forever.
 <LI> Every year for the next 12 years, you would receive $10,000 from sales
of the product.
</UL>
<p>
In summary, you give away $100,000 and you get $120,000 back.  Is this 
a good deal?  Let's look at the returns in terms of Net Present Value (NPV):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Adapted from <I>Sit and Solve Brainteasers</I> by Derick Niederman
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H4> Warm Up </H4>
Five watermelons, each of different weight, have been weighed in <i>pairs</I>
to obtain the following weights:
<p>
<CENTER><B>
20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31
</B></CENTER>
<p>

One way to solve this would be to figure out a mathematical algorithm for this number of watermelons and work out the weight of each watermelon. 
Another would be to try all of the possible combinations of weights five watermelons until you found one that has this same set of combinations of weights.
Either way you did it, the specific set of watermelons that produces these weights is
<p>
<CENTER><B>
 [ 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 ]
</B></CENTER>
<p>

<H4> Procedure </H4> 
Since we have computers, and know how to write code, trying all of the possible weights of the five watermelons is now much easier. In this extension, 
you will take in an array of 10 weights, and you will try, iteratively, to come up with the individual weights of the five watermelons.

<p>In this extension we will introduce <kbd>vectors</kbd> which are defined in the <kbd>vector</kbd> header. Vectors work a lot like arrays with a couple
very important differences. Before you start this extension, familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/">vector class</a></p>

<OL>
<LI>
Find the code for this extension in the <KBD>watermelons</KBD> package.
<LI> Take a look at <KBD>watermelons.h</kbd> and familiarize yourself with the functions required.
<LI> Create two methods in the <KBD>Watermelons</KBD> source file. There is one finished method that will help you write the other two 
methods. The two methods you must create are:
<DL>
 <DT> <KBD>int[] allPairSums(int[] nums)
 <DD> This method must be completed first.  Given the input array
<KBD>nums</KBD>, this method computes the pairwise-sum of each distinct
pair of index values for that array.  For example, given the
input <KBD>{40, 20, 10, 30}</KBD>, the method must compute the sums of
indices 
<KBD>(0,1)</KBD>,
<KBD>(0,2)</KBD>,
<KBD>(0,3)</KBD>,
<KBD>(1,2)</KBD>,
<KBD>(1,3)</KBD>,
<KBD>(2,3)</KBD>, returning the array
<CENTER>
<KBD>{60, 50, 70, 30, 50, 40}</KBD>
</CENTER>
The ordering of the elements in the returned array does not matter.
<DT> <KBD>int[] getSolution(int[] originalSums)</KBD>
<DD> This method returns a solution to the puzzle for the array of 10 integers that are passed into it. The ordering of elements
in the array you produce does not matter, as far as the provided unit test is concerned. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The included method, <KBD>bool sameIntArrays(vector<int> one, vector<int> two)</KBD> 
will help you with this method. When you pass two integer arrays into <KBD>sameIntArrays</KBD>, it checks whether the two integer vectors contain the same elements.
The order of the elements in the arrays does not matter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<LI> Make sure you pass the provided tests in <kbd>WatermelonsTest</kbd>.  Once it does, you will
have a solution to the puzzle.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Do this by calling your <KBD>multPos</KBD> method:
<UL>
<LI> Pass <KBD>multPos</KBD> the absolute values of <KBD>j</KBD> and <KBD>k</KBD>.  It should
return the product of those positive values.
<LI> Compute this method's return value based on the result of <KBD>multPos</KBD> and based
on the signs
of <KBD>j</KBD> and </KBD>k</KBD>.
