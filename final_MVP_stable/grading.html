<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
We recognize that students enter CSE131 with a wide variety of
backgrounds.  Therefore,
CSE131 strives for a non-competetive learning environment. Our aim is to
help you learn, not filter you out. To avoid putting you in competition
with your classmates, we will not compare students in the determination
of grades for CSE131.  No <i>means</i> are used and there are no <i>curves</i>.

   Your semester score is computed as the following weighted average:

      You earn credit for studios simply by participation.  The studios are

      are essentially a substitute for lecture, except that you learn actively
      by <i>doing</i> rather than by listening.

         At the end of each studio session, you are cleared by a TA and your

   <dt> Labs
   </dt>
   <dd>
      Each module of this course has a lab assignment.   Most labs are
      graded by the demo you perform in front of a TA.  The TA will inspect your
      code, watch your demo, and pass you on that lab assignment if both are
      satisfactory.
      <p>
         We reserve the right to inspect your labs for style, and to refuse credit
         for labs
         do not meet the <a href="style.html">style standards</a> 
         for this course.  In such cases you may resubmit the work as a <i>late</i>
         lab (see below).
      </p>
      <p>
         Labs are due as posted on the <a href="Calendar_131.html">course calendar and
         syllabus</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         We realize that you are taking other courses, and that you may occasionally
         need more time to complete a lab.  You are given a certain
         number of late-lab coupons as
         described in the <a href="late-policy.html">late policy</a>, and these are spent automatically
         when you demo a lab after its regular deadline
         and before its <i>late</i> deadline.  
         <p>
            Once you are out

      <p>
         Your lab score is the fraction of labs you have completed as compared
         to those assigned.  Thus, your lab score will be 100% if all labs 
         are completed as described above.

         While the labs test your basic knowledge of the course material, the
         extensions serve both to reinforce each module specifically but also to
         integrate techinques between the modules.
         <p>
            Extensions are demonstrated like labs, with
            a TA evaluating both your code and its functionality.  Please read the following

         </li>
         <li>
            Your fractional (or percentage) score for extensions, overall, is simply the
            sum of your valid extension points, taken out of 100.
            <!--
               <LI> Valid points in excess of 100 still count toward your extension score, thus
               effectively
               earning you extra points that count toward your overall grade, in proportion to the 
               weight given to your extension score.
               <BLOCKQUOTE>
               For example, if extensions count 25% toward your overall course score, then each
               4 points over 100 that you earn in valid extension points adds one point to your overall
               course score.

               -->

         <li> The maximum number of points you can earn for extensions is 100 points.
            Extra points
            do not count toward any aspect of your grades
            for this course.
         </li>
         <li> The validity of your extension points is associated with turning in a certain

            the i<sup>th</sup> deadline.
            <blockquote>
               For example, if there are 3 deadlines, 1/3 of your points are due at the first deadline,
               2/3 are due by the second deadline, and all of your points are due by the third deadline.

            you can earn for extensions to n/i the points you have at the i<sup>th</sup> deadline.
            <blockquote>
               Continuing the example, you will be awarded no more than 3 times the points you
               have at your first deadline, 3/2 the points you have at your second deadline, and

<h3>What if I feel my work was not graded properly?</h3>
Once a grade for an assignment has been posted to blackboard, 
you have <b>one week</b>

<blockquote>
   It is your responsibility to check your grades and make an appeal, if
   appropriate, in the alloted time period.
   <ul>
      <li> A request of this nature will trigger a regrade of all aspects of the
         work associated with that grade.  It is possible this review will result
         in a lower, not higher score.  So proceed carefully.
      </li>
      <li> If the work in question was of a written nature, the work must be
         submitted with no alteration of the contents.

<h2>Late Policy</h2>
Success in CSE131 depends critically on keeping up with the assignments.
At the same time, we don't want you to be stressed out over deadlines.
With this in mind, the the following late policy has been established.
<em>Please read it carefully</em> so that you understand your options. Exceptions
to this policy will be granted only in the case of a documented 
extended illness or a
documented family emergency.

         <b>Studios</b>
      </p>
   </dt>
   <dd>
      Studio atttendance is mandatory, but you may experience situations that prevent
      attendance.  You must correspond with the instructor to get an <i>excused</i> absence from studio, if you wish to receive credit, and that studio must be performed with the
      TAs during their office hours.  You are allowed one unexcused studio absence in the semester.  Any unexcused absences beyond that will drop your studio score for the course
      to zero.

   <dt>
      <b>Lab Assignments</b>
   </dt>
   <p></p>
   <dd>
      Start assignments right away,
      so you have time to complete them and submit them by the due date.  If you wait until the last minute and get stuck, you may have trouble getting help.  Also, by finishing labs on time, you will be ready to start each new lab
      as soon as it is assigned.
      <p>
         The deadline for any assignment may be extended at the discretion of
         the instructor.  The CEC labs may be unavailable for brief
         periods due to unforseen circumstances.
         Such outages are to be expected
         and will not normally result in an extension.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Late coupons:</b>  Each student is issued three virtual late coupons
         for use during this semester.  A coupon can be used to extend the time
         of one lab by exactly one week.  No penalty will be assessed for the late
         lab, but the virtual coupon will be consumed.  Using a late coupon is the
         only mechanism for submitting a lab late, and at most one coupon can be
         spent on any lab.
      </p>
      <p>
         Occasionally, you may demo a lab to the TAs and receive credit for
         that lab, but an
         error may surface in subsequent testing or grading that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
         If a successfully demonstrated lab is later found to be faulty,
         you may correct the lab to enable it
         to pass the tests without using a late coupon.  This policy
         does not, however, allow the demonstration of a lab
         with known problems.  Demo work that you fully believe to
         be correct.  The TAs will check it during the demonstration.
      </p>

      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>
      <b>Lab Demos</b>
   </dt>
   <p></p>
   <dd>
      Most lab assignments require that you give a demonstration
      of your working lab to a TA.  This must be done during a lab section.
      Normally, you will do this demo during <i>your</i> lab section, but 
      sometimes you may have a scheduling problem and need to demo
      during a different lab section.
      In any case, you should <b>complete your demo by the end of lab sessions on the
      day your lab is due</b>,
      or a late coupon must be used.
      <p>
         If you are doing a demo in a lab section, you must sign up for your demo
         at the <b>beginning</b> of the lab section (within the
         first 15 minutes).
         This is necessary to avoid everyone clamoring
         to do demos in the last 5 minutes.

<p>
   You are encouraged to work with other students on your assignments,
   and to help other students find and fix problems in their programs,
   provided that you comply with the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <b>Honestly represent your work.</b>
      The material you turn in for course credit must be a fair
      representation of your own work. 
      <em>Copying another's work is strictly prohibited.</em>
      <p>
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b>Give help appropriately.</b> When helping someone, it is
      important not to simply give them a solution, because then they may
      not understand it fully and will not be able to solve a similar problem next
      time.  It's always important to take the time to help someone think
      through the problem and develop the solution.  Often, this can be
      accomplished by asking them a series of leading questions.  Remember
      the old saying: 
      <p> </p>
      <center> <em>Give someone a fish and they'll eat
         for a day.<br> Teach someone to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime.
         </em>
      </center>
      <em> </em> 
      <p> 
      </p>
      <p> </p>
   </li>
   <li><b>Give credit for help received.</b> If you receive help from
      people (besides the TAs and the instructor), you must list their names 
      where appropriate using comments in the material you submit.
   </li>
   <li>
      <b>Work individually or in groups.</b> 
   </li>
   <li>
      Studio work is collaborative and is always performed in groups of 
      two to three people.
      Working in groups can be
      beneficial because you can discuss design options and catch each
      other's mistakes.  
   </li>
   <li>
      Pair programming is
      permitted for most lab assignments, subject to the following rules:
      <ol>
         <li>Only two people may work together.  (Groups of three or more are not allowed because it reduces participation of each group member.)
         </li>
         <li>You must work side by side on the entire lab.  It is your resposibility to schedule time to complete the lab when both of you are available.
         </li>
         <li>You must take turns at the keyboard, preferably switching at each step of the assignment.
         </li>
         <li>You must discuss each solution as you are completing the lab (not just watch the other person type).
         </li>
         <li>You may NOT divide up the assignment and each do part of it.  Both parthers must participate in completing the entire assignment.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <b>If in doubt, ask your instructor.</b> Be
      sure to ask in advance if you have any doubts about whether a certain
      type of collaboriation is acceptable.  
   </li>

      You are required to work through
      the online resources <b>before your appointed studio time.</b>  These include
      short video segments and exercises that you submit for participation credit.
      <blockquote>
         If you don't watch the video segments and do the exercises before you start asking questions, here's what will happen. You won't get help and you may not get credit for the studio.

      <!--
         <B>Recitation sections</B> are offered as shown on the
         <a href="../Cal/"> course calendar</a>.  If you are signed up for
         a recitation section, then you are expected to attend and participate.
         <BLOCKQUOTE>
         By talking with the course's head TA,
         you can add or drop a recitation section as you wish, but your eligibility
         to retake a quiz depends on your participation in a recitation 
         section.

      <b>Studio attendance is required and must be done in class</b>
      Do not show up with a studio already done unless you have arranged this with the instructor. You cannot earn credit for a studio you miss.  You must arrange to make up
      any missed studios with the instructor.  This should be done in advance if it is a planned absence. I will not grant makeups retroactively for job interviews, etc. To the extent that space
      is available, you can attend any studio session if circumstances prevent your
      attending your assigned session.

      <p><b>Attendance in lab sections is also important.</b> Any graded materials
         will
         be returned in lab sections, and you will have an opportunity to discuss
         written comments with the TAs during lab. Also, most lab assignments
         require a demonstration of your working program in the lab section
         on the due date.
         You must attend your lab section in
         order to give the required demonstration.
