<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>Recursive sum</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> In the <KBD>exercises6</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, create
<UL>
  <LI> <KBD>Sum.java</KBD> as a Java class
  <LI> <KBD>SumTest.java</KBD> as a JUnit test file
</UL>
  <LI> Complete both so that sum is computed as defined by the explicitly
recursive formula:
<UL>
  <LI> sum(n) = sum(n-1) + n, if n &gt; 0
  <LI> sum(n) = 0, otherwise
</UL>
  <LI> Write some tests for sum and run the unit test file to make sure
your function works.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember that you have to have a <KBD>@Test</KBD> directive above any
unit test method, as shown in the video.

<H3>Recursive addition</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> In the <KBD>exercises6</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, complete the
<UL>
  <LI> <KBD>Add.java</KBD>
  <LI> <KBD>addTest.java</KBD>
</UL>
  <LI> Complete both so that addition is computed as defined by the explicitly
recursive formula:
<UL>
  <LI> add(x,y) = x, if y = 0
  <LI> add(x,y) = add(x+1,y-1), otherwise
</UL>
  <LI> Write some more tests for add and run the unit test file to make sure
your function works.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember that you have to have a <KBD>@Test</KBD> directive above any
unit test method, as shown in the video.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Under what conditions on x and y does your method operate correctly?
<LI> How could you complete the <KBD>addAll(x,y)</KBD> method so it works
for any <KBD>x</KBD> and <KBD>y</KBD>?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
See the code, as a hint is given there.

<H3>Base Cases</H3>
<DL>
 <DT> Part 1
 <DD>
In the video, one possible explanation for human reproduction was given,
namely that a woman is born with all of the babies already inside her that
she would ever deliver.  This idea is attributed to
<a href="http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?id=65"> Anton von Leeuwenhoek</a> 
who, as a lensmaker, greatly advanced the use of microscopes in studying biology.
In terms of recursion and base cases, what is wrong with
von Leeuwenhoek's speculation?
  <DT> Part 2
  <DD>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> In the <KBD>exercises6</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, find and open the
<KBD>FactorialNoBaseCase</KBD> class.
  <LI> Run the class as a Java Application.
  <LI> What happens, and why?
</UL>

<H3>Graph Paper</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> In the <KBD>exercises6</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, find and open the
<KBD>GraphPaper</KBD> class.
  <LI> Complete the class so that it produces a grid on the screen
<UL>
<LI> Think about the recursive substructure of drawing a grid
<LI> Think about the base case(s)
</UL>
</UL>
