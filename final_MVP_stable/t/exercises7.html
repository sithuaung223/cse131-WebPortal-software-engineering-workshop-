<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>Design your own object</H3>
You have seen examples of object design in the videos.  Now it's your turn.
<UL>
  <LI> Think of an object you want to design:  perhaps something important
or relevant to your life.  It should be some kind of noun, related to your
studies, hobbies, or other interests.
  <LI> In the <KBD>exercises7</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, create a new class named
appropriately for the object you are designing.
  <LI> In that file, define the object's instance variables, constructor(s),
and methods.  Provide accessors and mutators where appropriate.
</UL>
