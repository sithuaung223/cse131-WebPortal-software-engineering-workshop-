<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>Making a copy of an array, and Pig Latin</H3>
There are two parts to this exercise:
<UL>
  <LI> First you will make a copy of an
array.  
  <LI> Then you will change your code so that as you copy, you create
the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a> version of 
each string from the original array.
</UL>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>CopyArraysAndPigLatin</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises3</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
<LI> Write code to make a copy of the provided <KBD>names</KBD> array.
We do this so that we can
make changes to the copy without affecting the original array.
If we call the copy array <KBD>copy</KBD>,  then the steps you take
are as follows:
<UL> 
  <LI> Allocate the <KBD>copy</KBD> array with enough space to hold 
each of the elements of <KBD>name</KBD>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Do not use constants here:  pretend that the <KBD>names</KBD> array could
be of any length.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> Iterate over the <KBD>names</KBD> array to assign each element of
<KBD>copy</KBD> from <KBD>names</KBD>.
</UL>
 <LI> Check your results by iterating over <KBD>copy</KBD> and printing
each element.
 <LI> Now go back and cause each element of the <KBD>copy</KBD> array to have
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a> version of 
each string in the original <KBD>names</KBD> array.
</UL>

<H3>Making a shuffled copy of an array</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>Shuffle</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises3</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> It declares an array of strings called <KBD>original</KBD> that 
contains the strings <KBD>A</KBD> through <KBD>H</KBD>, in alphabetical order.
  <LI> The goal of this exercise is to shuffle this array, or a copy of it
as you prefer, so at to obtain a randomized order of the strings.
  <LI> This is tricky, so try your best but don't feel bad if you need to
see the solution before you have it working completely.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can watch just enough of the solution video to get unstuck and then try
moving forward on your own.

<H3>Creating a multiplication table</H3>
<UL>
<LI> 
Long before computers existed as electronic machines, the word
<EM><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/computor">computor</a></EM> was a name for a human whose job consisted of
computing and tabulating mathematical results.
<LI> In this exercise, you produce a table of products.
</UL>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>TimesTable</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises3</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> Complete the class so it prints a table of products, as shown
on the introductory video.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your columns should line up nicely, assuming that all products take at most
2 digits.  In other words, it should look nice when given an input value of 9.
For greater values, your columns need not line up but the data should be
correct.
