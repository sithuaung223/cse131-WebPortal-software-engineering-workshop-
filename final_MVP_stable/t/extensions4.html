</UL></DL>
We have seen how <a href="http://www.jimloy.com/physics/harmony.htm">
sound can be represented as a summation of sine waves</a>.
In this extension, you will process a description of an instrument, which
specifies the relative intensities of that instruments
<a href="">overtones</a>.  You will modify a copy of <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> so that
the sound emitted for each note has the profile of the specified instrument.
<H4>Warm Up</H4>
<UL>
 <LI> Update your repository and locate the <KBD>instrument</KBD> package
in the <KBD>extensions</KBD> folder.  
 <LI> You will find a copy of
<KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> in the <KBD>instrument</KBD> package, credited
to Sedgewick's book, as this code is adpated from Sedgewick's <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD>.
  <LI> Run <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD> and verify that it plays the music
files correctly.
</UL>
<H4>Overview</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> For the purposes of this work, let's define a <I>frequency factor</I> as a multiplicative factor to be applied
to a frequency <KBD>f</KBD>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the example below, let's assume that <KBD>f</KBD> is 440&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second), which is concert A. On a piano, this is the
A above middle C:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/a440.gif" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
<UL>
  <LI> a factor of <KBD>1</KBD> results in the same frequency as <KBD>f</KBD>, because <KBD>1*f==f</KBD>.
  <LI> a factor of <KBD>2</KBD> yields a frequency <B>an octave higher</B> than <KBD>f</KBD>.
<p>
For this example, we obtain
880&nbsp;Hz, which is the A above high C on a piano:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/a880.gif" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
  <LI> a factor of <KBD>4</KBD> yields a frequency <B>two octaves higher</B> than <KBD>f</KBD>.  
<p>
Here we obtain
1760&nbsp;Hz, an octave above the A above high C:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/a1760.gif" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
  <LI> a factor of <KBD>3</KBD> is between one and two octaves higher, and it turns out to be one octave plus 
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth">just (or, pure) fifth</a>
above
the pitch corresponding to <KBD>f</KBD>.
Here we obtain the frequency 1320&nbsp;Hz, which sounds like the E above high C.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/e3x.gif" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
The sound is slightly different than on a piano, where the pitches are not perfect but are instead evenly spaced apart
from each other.  The corresponding note on the piano has a frequency of 1318.51&nbsp;Hz, slightly flatter than
what we get by our frequency factor.
  <LI> a factor of <KBD>0.75</KBD> (ratio of 3:4) yields a note that sounds like an E, but dividing by 4 lowers its
pitch by two octaves.   With <KBD>f</KBD> at concert A, a frequency factor of 3:4 yields a frequency of 330, whichsounds like the E above middle C:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/e34.gif" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
Again, the pitch on a piano is slightly different;  in this case it
is slightly flatter at  329.63.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> It is thus convenient to specify a frequency factor as the ratio of
two integers.  In the above examples we see 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 3:4.
  <LI> To build an actual instrument, we must pick the frequency factors we
wish to hear, and specify how strong each should be.  The table below
specifies such an instrument:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The first row is the fundamental frequency.  The second is an octave higher, and is 3/4 as strong as the fundamental frequency.  The third row specifies a
pitch that is a fifth above the fundamental freqnecy, and quieter still at
half the strength of the fundamental frequency.
<p>
The waveform that results from such an instrument specification is shown
below in red, with the three frequency factors shown in black:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/instr.jpg" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI> The <FONT COLOR="red">red solid waveform</FONT> is literally the sum of the
<FONT COLOR="black">black dotted waveforms</FONT>.  The 
sound you produce is sampled from the red waveform, and that <B>is</B> the
subject of this extension.
<LI> The plot shown above is not the subject of this extension, but is shown
to help explain how complex sounds are built from simple ones,
as follows:
<UL>
<LI> The black waveform with the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude">amplitude</a> (the tallest
black waveform) is the fundamental frequency
at relative strength 1.  The sample shown is for 1/440 of a second of a
440&nbsp;Hz concert-A.  This is sufficient ot show one full cycle of the
fundamental frequency.
<LI>  The black waveform with the next largest amplitude has relative strength 0.75.  It is
an octave higher, so it oscillates twice in the timespan of the
fundamental pitch's waveform.
<LI> The black waveform of smallest amplitude (at half the strength of
the fundamental frequency) is the 3:2 frequency factor, which sounds
like a fifth above the fundamental frequency.  As expected, it exhibits 
1.5 cycles in the timespan of the fundamental pitch's waveform.
</UL>
<LI> The sound of the red waveform, which is what you will produce below, is
similar to an oboe or a clarinet (in the opinion of my son).
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<H4>Procedure</H4>
<OL>
  <LI> First prompt the user for how many frequency factors the user wishes
to specify.  In the above example, 3 such frequencies were used.
  <LI> For each frequency factor, prompt the user for its
<UL>
  <LI> Numerator (an <KBD>int</KBD>)
  <LI> Denominator (an <KBD>int</KBD>)
  <LI> Relative strength (a <KBD>double</KBD>)
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The information about the frequency factors must be saved (in arrays)
for future use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> The code in <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD>, copied with attribution
from <KBD>PlayThatTune</KBD>, reads in a file and computes a value
in a variable called <KBD>hz</KBD> that is the fundamental frequency
of the tune being played.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <KBD>hz</KBD> value is computed from concert A (440&nbsp;Hz), taking the specified
number of equally spaced chromatic steps above (or below) concert A.
<p>
The relevant details, explained in the lecture slides for this module,
are not necessary to complete this extension, but please ask if you would
like clarification.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Your task is to modify the assignment to the sample <KBD>a[i]</KBD> in
the provided code:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/origformula.png" WIDTH=500></CENTER>
The sine wave sampled and assigned there is for:
<UL>
 <LI>  the fundamental frequency (<KBD>hz</KBD>, shown in the red box) of the desired pitch
  <LI> relative strength <KBD>1.0</KBD> (the result of the sine function call
is implicitly multiplied by 1, shown at the red dot).
</UL>
<p>
In place of that value, you must compute the sum of sine wave samples, one
for each frequency factor, as follows:
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>a[i]</KBD> is initially zero.
<LI> For each frequency factor
<KBD>f<sub>k</sub></KBD>, add to <KBD>a[i]</KBD> a sample obtained
as follows:
<UL>
<LI> 
  The value passed to the sine function must be multiplied by the 
frequency factor.  This means multiplying the red-boxed <KBD>hz</KBD> by the ratio of the
numerator and denominator of the frequency factor.
 <LI> The value returned from the sine function must be multiplied by the
relative strength of the frequency factor.  This happens at the red dot.
</UL>
</UL>
<LI> Test your program on the <KBD>A.txt</KBD> file first, which is a
single note.  Then try <KBD>Ascale.txt</KBD> and some other songs.

<H2>Extension 2: Draw a Sound Wave (10 points):</H2><p>
<DL><DT>Authors<DD><UL>
  <LI> 
</UL></DL>
<H4>Warm Up</H4>
To understand this extension, you should first be familiar with the 
extension in which an instrument's sound is produced as the sum of
sine waves.
<p>
You will modify your program further in this extension to produce the sine-wave
plots that depict how sine-wave addition occurs.
<p>
The details of this assignment are not completely specified so that
you must think through what is needed to produce meaningful plots.
Ask for help as needed!
<H4>Procedure</H4>
<UL>
<LI> An example of a plot is shown below:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Extensions/instr.jpg" WIDTH=350></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI> The black waveform with the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude">amplitude</a> (the tallest
black waveform) is the fundamental frequency
at relative strength 1.  The waves shown are for 1/440 of a second of a
440&nbsp;Hz concert-A.  This is sufficient ot show one full cycle of that
fundamental frequency.
<LI>  The black waveform with the next largest amplitude has relative strength 0.75.  It is
an octave higher, so it oscillates twice in the timespan of the
fundamental pitch's waveform, at 880&nbsp;Hz.
<LI> The black waveform of smallest amplitude (at half the strength of
the fundamental frequency) is 660&nbsp;Hz: the 3:2 frequency factor, which sounds
like a fifth above the fundamental frequency.  As expected, it exhibits 
1.5 cycles in the timespan of the fundamental pitch's waveform.
<LI> The red waveform is the sum of the black ones.
</UL>
<LI> Each of the frequency factors incorporated into an instrument
is shown separately by plotting dots of the curve as the values
are computed.
<LI> With frequencies on the order of hundereds or thousands of
cycles per second, we must limit the time of the plot so that we
can see one or two cycles clearly.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Think about how many <B>samples</B> you need to capture to show
one complete cycle at 440&nbsp;Hz.  
<p>
One way to reason about this is to use
the units of the various computations and multiply or divide them to obtain
the property you seek.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Plot the individual waveforms using black dots, as shown above.
<LI> Plot the summation waveform using red connected line segments, as shown
above.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic Eight Ball</a>
is an autoresolution device. A question of <KBD>boolean</KBD> type is
posed, the Magic Eight Ball is turned over, and it then displays its advice
in a murky window.  It has resurfaced in other guises over the ages, most
recently perhaps as <a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Conch_Shell"> The Magic Conch Shell</a> in the
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob">Club SpongeBob</a>
episode of 
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com"> SpongeBob SquarePants</a>.
<p>
To receive credit for this extension, your implementation of the
Magic 8 Ball must:
<UL>
  <LI> Repeatedly prompt the user for his or her question using <KBD>ArgsProcessor</KBD>.
  <LI> Dramatically cause the answer to emerge in a (<KBD>StdDraw</KBD>)
display, over a 2-5 second period, as follows:
<UL>
  <LI> Display the result in a triangular shape, such as shown
<a href="http://www.indra.com/cgi-bin/spikes-8-ball"> here</a>. (Your solution
will be much more dramatic as you include the following.)  Your triangle
need not rotate.
   <LI> Your rendering must fade the image from black to showing the
triangle with text in a continuous manner, as the answer emerges.
   <LI> Your rendering of the answer must cause the text go from blurry to
sharp as the answer emerges.
   <LI> Try to have a suitably eerie sound accompany your display. (not necessary
for credit, but nice)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This extension has been brought back from the 131 vaults, having originally
been conceived by Ken Goldman, formerly a professor in our department and
currently at Google.  In its new form, it has been rewritten to comform
to Sedgewick's API.  Also, it does not make use of objects, so it can
be offered as an extension at this point in the course.
<p>
Although the solution can be quite short (mine weighed in at approximately
50 lines), there are some tricky aspects to this work, and it may be an
extension that you work on over several weeks.
<p>
You will have to interact with the mouse, perhaps for the first time, both
in terms of its location and determining whether the mouse has been pressed and
released.  It will take patience to get this to work, but most students like
the end result.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4> The idea</H4>
<UL>
   <LI> Each time the mouse is clicked, an eyeball is deposited on the image.
   <LI> Each eyeball consists of two parts:
   <UL>
      <LI> An outer filled circle that is white with a thin black border.  This part
        of the eyeball does not move as the mouse moves around the screen.
      <LI> An inner filled circle with of some color (mine are red, below).
This part of the eyeball does move, so that the eyeball can appear to be
looking at something.
   </UL>
   <LI> All eyeballs seem to look at the mouse, wherever the mouse moves within
    the <KBD>StdDraw</KBD> window.

The mouse (not shown) is to the right, so the eyeball is looking that way.
</TD>
<TD> Then I clicked a second time to deposit another eyeball, this time
over the right eye shown in the image.
<p>
Both eyeballs are looking at my mouse, which is at the lower right (not shown).
</TD>

Each time I click the mouse, another eyeball is deposited, and all eyeballs
continue looking at my mouse, wherever it happens to be.

</CENTER>
<H4> Part 0: Initialize your application</H4>
<UL>
 <LI> Begin by drawing the picture in the image.
 <LI> Prompt the user to specify the maximum number of eyeballs that
      will be drawn.  This information is necessary so that you can
      appropriately provision arrays needed to implement this extension.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE> This code is included in your repository.  Open the
<KBD>extensions</KBD> folder in which you will find the <KBD>eyeballs</KBD>
package. Open and run the <KBD>Eyeballs</KBD> class.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4> Part 1:  Detecting mouse clicks</H4>
Most programs that interact with the mouse use a <I>listener</I> model that
takes action when the mouse is moved, pressed, released, or clicked (a press
and release action).
<p>
Unfortunately, in Sedgewick's API, we can only determine the current
status of a mouse button as up or down.  We must then use logic and
iteration to discover whether a mouse has been pressed, released, or 
clicked.
This low-level API for the mouse leads to
some mixed feelings about how you are learning to interact with the mouse:
<UL>
  <LI> The code you write will not be typical of how most Java programs
interact with the mouse.  The reason for this is that your work takes
place in an infinite loop, slowed only by the use of <KBD>StdDraw.pause(n)</KBD>,
which consumes resources on your computer even when you are not moving
the mouse.
  <LI> You are essentially <I>polling</I> the mouse as to whether it
is up or down, and then using your own logic to determine whether
it has been pressed, released, clicked, or dragged.  
From a pedagogical perspective, you
will learn how this kind of processing takes place at a low level on some
computers.  You also learn how to track the <I>state</I> of an input device
over time, and many applications require this kind of logic.
</UL>
<p>
Following is a description of mouse actions as they are typically 
used in most applications:
<DL>
 <DT> Mouse press
 <DD> We think of this as a single push-down action on a mouse or trackpad.
This action usually initiates some activity in applications.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From an application's point of view,
this event
happens just once when the mouse is pushed down.  Generation of another mouse
press action would require the mouse to be released, and then pressed again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <DT> Mouse release
 <DD> If a mouse has been pressed, then it can be released.  Some applications
distinguish between the press and release, so that the mouse can move between
those actions.  This is sometimes called <I>dragging</I> the mouse.
  <DT> Mouse click
  <DD> While this is a compound action, consisting of a mouse press
followed by a mouse release, it is usually treated as an atomic action that
takes place at exactly one coordinate.  The release also happens within some
reasonable timeframe of the press, if the press and release are to be
construed as a click.
</DL>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The above mouse actions are the logical ones that we wish
to implement.  Actually, it suffices for this extension to
determine only a mouse release, but you are welcome to think about how to
discover the other actions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The Sedgwick API offers only the following interface, which
we must use in our application to simulate the above mouse actions.
<DL>
  <DT> <KBD>double mouseX()
  <DD> returns the x-coordinate of the mouse, expressed in terms of
the coordinates of the <KBD>StdDraw</KBD> canvas.

  <DT> <KBD>double mouseY()
  <DD> returns the y-coordinate of the mouse, expressed in terms of
the coordinates of the <KBD>StdDraw</KBD> canvas.

  <DT> <KBD>boolean mousePressed()
  <DD> A better name for this would be <KBD>boolean isMouseDown()</KBD>, because
this method does not detect a mouse press in the standard view of mouse
actions.  Instead it simply reports whether the mouse button is currently 
pressed or not.
</DL>
<p>
Your task is to simulate a mouse-click action using the above API.  
This will inevitably involve <I>polling</I> the mouse as to whether the
button is down or up.  Consider the following code:
<PRE>
while (!StdDraw.mousePressed()) {
    // do nothing, 
    // we are waiting for the mouse button to go down  
    //
    // The line below is important, as described below
    //
    StdDraw.show(50);
}
</PRE>
<UL>
  <LI> Without the pause using <KBD>StdDraw.show(50)</KBD>, this application 
would run in a <I>tight</I> loop
that would always keep your computer busy, even if you are not interacting
with the application.   As a result, all of the other applications open on your
computer would suffer from not getting sufficient CPU resources to be
reponsive.  These applications would appear to behave sluggishly.
  <LI> Sedgewick uses the pause intervals to hide updates that you make to
       the drawing canvas.   Between calls to show, no updates are shown.
       At the call to show, the screen is redrawn, and the CPU is released
       for the specified period of time (50 milliseconds in the above code).
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Make sure your eyeballs are depositing properly as you mouse-click before
you move on to implement more features.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4> Part 2: Following the mouse movement</H4>
<p>
A pupil within an eyeball tracks objects using the geometry of similar
triangles.  The following diagram and discussion may be useful.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="Extensions/eyeball.png">
</CENTER>
<UL>
 <LI> The eyeball is centered at <KBD>(ex,ey)</KBD> and is looking at the
    object (the mouse) at <KBD>(mx,my)</KBD>.  
This leads to the following equations:
<UL>
  <LI> <KBD>mx = ex + dx</KBD>
  <LI> <KBD>my = ey + dy</KBD>
</UL>
<LI> Knowing <KBD>(ex,ey)</KBD> and <KBD>(mx,my)</KBD>, we can solve
for <KBD> dx</KBD> and <KBD>dy</KBD>.
<LI> Knowing <KBD>dx</KBD> and <KBD> dy</KBD>, we can 
compute <KBD>d</KBD> using the distance formula.
<LI>  We know <KBD>p</KBD>, because it is the radius of the eyeball minus
the radius of the pupil.  This may be hard to see, but convince yourself
of this by looking carefully at the figure.
<LI> The green triangle is similar to the large triangle.
<LI> Knowing <KBD> p </KBD>  and <KBD>d</KBD>, we can compute their ratio.
<LI> That same ratio describes 
<KBD>px</KBD>:<KBD>dx</KBD>
<KBD>py</KBD>:<KBD>dy</KBD>.
<LI> From those ratios we can compute <KBD> px</KBD> and <KBD> py</KBD>.
<LI> Knowing <KBD>(ex,ey)</KBD>, <KBD>px</KBD>, and <KBD>py</KBD>, we can
compute the center of the red pupil as <KBD>(ex+px,ey+py)</KBD>.
</UL>
<H4>Putting it all together</H4>
Your code is like the bouncing ball code, in that it enacts a sequence
of frames.  Each frame consists of checking whether and where a new eyeball
should be deposited.  Moreover, all existing eyeballs must be updated so
that they appear to be tracking the mouse as it moves through the window.
<p>
Give yourself time for this extension, and develop and test the aspects
in the order described above.

<H2>Extension 7: Web Scraper (3 points):</H2><p>

<H4>Intro</H4>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Web scrapers</a> are programs that search websites and scrape off useful data. 
You will write a web scraper in this assignment that looks for weather
information in a zip code of interest.  There are two ways to go about this:
<UL>
<LI> The result of accessing a web URL is a stream of text which
you can receive a a Java <KBD>String</KBD>.  You can scan
that <KBD>String</KBD> for information of interest.  In this approach, you
search for features that delimit the area of interest, and trim the <KBD>String</KBD>
to extract data of interest.
<LI> A library has been developed
for Java called <KBD><a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a></KBD> that allows 
direct interaction with a website's HTML.  This library regards a web document
in terms of its structure.  You use methods from this library to navigate to
the part of the web page that is of interest.
</UL>
<DL>
 <DT> URLs and web sites
 <DD> <UL>
  <LI> Watch <a href="Extensions/scraping1.mp4">this video</a> which
demonstrates how URLs are used in the 
<KBD><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/" target="weather">http://www.wunderground.com/</a></KBD>
web site.
  <LI> We have to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineer</a>
how that web site uses URLs to request zip-code-specific weather information.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">Reverse engineering</a> skills are useful skills and can serve you well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> After watching the video, visit the 
<KBD><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/" target="weather">http://www.wunderground.com/</a></KBD> site
<LI> Take a look around for a bit to see what is offered there
<LI> Type into the field <KBD>Search Locations</KBD>  some zip code of interest
to you.  Examples might include
<UL>
  <LI> <KBD><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=63130" target="weather">63130</a></KBD> for Washington University
  <LI> <KBD><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=80424" target="weather">80424</a></KBD> for Breckenridge, Colorado
  <LI> <KBD><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=10598" target="weather">10598</a></KBD> for Yorktown Height, New York
</UL>
<LI> Observe that when you submit your request, you are taken to
a web page whose URL is different from the home page for the site.
</UL>
  <LI> Try editing the URL in your browser to find weather information
for a different zip code of interest to you.
  <LI> For one or more of the pages you reach, view the source of that
web page in your browser, as you saw in the video.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Browsers vary in how they allow you to see the page source.  If you are on
the web page of interest, try control- (right-) clicking and one option you
should see should resemble <KBD>View Page Source</KBD>.
<p>
If you are lost, try <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> for how
to view page source in your browser.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> Try to locate the text within the page source that corresponds to
the temperature report.  In the video, this was found near the
string <KBD>curTemp</KBD> in the source.
</UL>
  <DT> Simple use of <KBD>jsoup</KBD>
  <DD>
<UL>
  <LI> Watch <a href="Extensions/scraping2.mp4">this video</a> which
shows how to supply <KBD>jsoup</KBD> with  a URL within Java.
  <LI> The result of that interaction is a <KBD>String</KBD>.
</UL>
</DL>
In this assignment, you will process the text yourself after getting the
document's text using <KBD>jsoup</KBD>.  You could use methods in <KBD>jsoup</KBD>
to isolate what you need, but you can explore that on your own.
<p>
<H4>Procedure</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>Weather</KBD> class in the <KBD>scraping</KBD>
project of your <KBD>extensions</KBD> folder.
  <LI> That code is what you saw on the video, with comments added
to direct your work.
  <LI> Your task is essentially to isolate the temperature data and some
other statistic from the source text of the web page.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>
What makes this difficult is that the author of the web page doesn't know
you want to find this information.  
<LI>You have to look at the web page yourself
to find distinguishing features of the page near where you want to extract
information.
<LI> Worse still, the author of that web page is not obligated to keep the
information you see in future versions of that web page.  Scraping is a
dodgy effort at best, and you may have to revise your code in response to
changes made by the author of the pages you scrape.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> It will be helpful to use some methods from the
<KBD><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a></KBD>
class.  The following describes some of those methods, assuming they
are called on a target <KBD>String t</KBD>.

at the supplied <KBD>beginIndex</KBD>.

  <DD> Returns a new <KBD>String</KBD> that is the substring of <KBD>t</KBD>, starting

<H2>Extension 100: Nutrition Again (C++) (8 points):</H2><p>
<DL><DT>Authors<DD><UL>
  <LI> Dan Nolan
</UL></DL>
<p>For this extension you will re-use your nutrition code from Lab 1, and potentially the C++ code you wrote from the similar extension. The difference is that this time instead of writing the information to terminal, you will use a file to write out the nutrition info and the analysis. You will then demonstrate your ability to read back in that file.
<blockquote>By completing this work, you  demonstrate that you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Utilize the input/output features of C++</li>
  <li>Incorporate new headers into existing work</li>
  <li>Produce meaningful output based on your computations</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>
 
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>	First, create a <kbd>nutritionFSteam</kbd> C++ source and header file in the
<KBD>nutrition</KBD> package of the <KBD>extensions</KBD> source folder.
  <li>Think about the information you need to write to the file, where you want white space, or where you do not.
  You should also think about which <b>Data Type</b> you should use for your information in order to write them out correctly. </li>
  <li>Consider making it as simple as possible to avoid unnecessary coding when you read it back in.</li>
  </ol>

<p>You will need to prompt the user for inputs just as before and calculate the same boolean values and caloric values</p>

<p>You will need to initailize a <KBD>ofstream</KBD> which stands for output file stream</p>

<p>You will also need to initialize a <KBD>ifstream</KBD> which stands for input file stream</p>

<p>Arrange for your program to produce output such that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It prompts the user for nutritional data from food</li>
  <li>It prompts the user for a file name to save under</li>
  <li>It writes out the file correctly, and read's in the file correctly</li>
</ul>


<b>Finally, your program should print the same exact information as it did before, but this time reading it from your file stream
rather than printing them out from your code directly. </b>
