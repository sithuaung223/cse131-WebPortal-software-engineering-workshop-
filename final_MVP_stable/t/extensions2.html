<H3>Manipulating an Image Raster</H3>

<P>
<B>Directions:</B> In the <KBD>imagetransforms</KBD> package, modify the provided <KBD>Transforms</KBD> Java program
to implement the methods as described below.
Your methods will use iteration (either <KBD>while</KBD> loops or <KBD>for</KBD> loops) to operate on the pixels of a picture.
<p>
<H4>Notes</H4>
<UL>
<LI> To run this extension, right (control) click on <KBD>Main</KBD> and choose <KBD>Run as...</KBD> then <KBD>Java Application</KBD>.  
<p>
This extension uses
the same base code as the filter extension.
<LI> 
The <KBD>Picture</KBD> class is a Sedgewick class whose API is documented on page 720 of our text.
The coordinates are expressed using the standard in computer science graphics: 
the coordinate <I>(x,y)</I> denotes
the pixel that is 
<UL>
<LI> <I>x</I> pixels to the right of the leftmost edge of the picture
<LI> <I>y</I> pixels down from the top edge of the picture
</UL>
Thus, <I>(0,0)</I> is the top left corner of the picture.
<LI>
Pixel addressing follows the common Java convention:  if there are <I>w</I> horizontal pixels, then 0 is
the first (leftmost) and <I>w-1</I> is the last (rightmost).
<LI>
Almost all of the methods are written in terms of two <KBD>Picture</KBD> parameters:
<UL>
<LI> <KBD>source</KBD>:  the picture to be used as input to your transformation
<LI> <KBD>target</KBD>:  the picture area to be used as output from your transformation
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is just one exception:  the <KBD>gradient</KBD> method produces its output
without needing a source.  Its only parameter is
<KBD>target</KBD>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<LI> Each <KBD>Picture</KBD> has a width and a height, and these can be obtained
for a <KBD>Picture p</KBD> as follows:
<PRE>
  int width  = p.width();
  int height = p.height();
</PRE>
<LI>
To find the <KBD>Color</KBD> of a pixel at location <KBD>x,y</KBD>, you use
<PRE>
  Color c = source.get(x,y);
</PRE>
<LI>
To set the <KBD>Color</KBD> of a pixel at location <KBD>x,y</KBD> to the color <KBD>c</KBD>, you use
<PRE>
  target.set(x,y,c);
</PRE>
</UL>

<H4>Instructions</H4>
<p>
Each of the methods described below is found in the <KBD>Transforms</KBD> class.
<OL>
<LI>The provided method <KBD>flipHoriz(Picture source, Picture target)</KBD> flips the image horizontally.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Look at the code given to you for this example
carefully.   It is broken into simple steps and the comments help explain why the pixel indexing works.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>Complete the method <KBD>flipVert(Picture source, Picture target)</KBD> that flips the image vertically. 
<CENTER>
<img src="Extensions/flipvert.png">
</CENTER>

<LI>Complete the method 
<KBD>flipHorizLeftHalf(Picture source, Picture target)</KBD> 
that flips the left half of the image horizontally.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The left half of the target image should be same as the source, but the right half of the target image should 
be the mirror of the left half of the source.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>
<img src="Extensions/fliplefthalf.png">

<P>
<LI>Complete the method 
<KBD>flipVertBotHalf(Picture source, Picture target)</KBD> 
that flips the bottom half of the image vertically.
<CENTER>
<img src="Extensions/flipbottomhalf.png">
</CENTER>

<LI>Complete the method <KBD>gradient(Picture target)</KBD> that takes a single <KBD>Picture</KBD>
as a parameter.
Your code
should create a <b>color gradient</b> by computing the following for each pixel:
<UL>
  <LI> The amount of red in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the left edge of the image, to 255 at the right edge of the image.  
   <LI> The amount of green in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the top edge of the image, to 255 at the bottom edge of the image.  
   <LI> The amount of blue in every pixel should be 128.  
</UL>
Thus, each pixel will have a different color depending on its position.  For example, the pixel at the top left will have red=0, green=0, and blue=128.  The pixel about 1/4 of the way down on the right edge will have red=255, green=64, and blue=128.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Develop an expression
for the amount of red and green in each pixel, given the x and y position of that pixel and the width and height of the image:
<PRE>
   int amountRed   = .....
   int amountGreen = ....
</PRE>
Then set the pixel at <I>(x,y)</I> to a color based on those computations:
<PRE>
    target.set(x, y, new Color(amountRed, amountGreen, 128));
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Loop invariants are a tool for proving that a loop computes some useful
result.  This topic is covered in a discrete math course, but you can try
your hand at some loop invariant proofs in this extension.
<p>
However, you must agree to the following:
<UL>
  <LI> You will watch <a href="Extensions/mpyinvariant.mp4">this video</a> before you ask any questions.
  <LI> You will meet with the instructor as indicated in the steps below.
  <LI> Those meetings will take place in office hours during the semester,
or during times otherwise arranged with the instructor.
  <LI> <B>Like all extensions, you get to choose whether you want to do
this extension. However, 
if you want to do it, then your work on this extension must be complete before the <em>first</em> extension deadline.</B>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Warm Up</H4>
Loops can be used to execute many simple operations. For instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For some a and b:
<PRE>
		int ans = 0;
		int i = 0;
		
		while(i != b){
		   i = i + 1;
		   ans = ans + a;
		}
</PRE>
This code computes the product of a and b.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
We have discussed this in <a href="Extensions/mpyinvariant.mp4">this video</a>,
and you can find the code in the <KBD>loopinvariants</KBD> package of the
<KBD>extensions</KBD> folder.  You are encouraged but not
required to create other classes in
that package to help you with your work below.
<H4>Part 1</H4>
Consider the following examples:
<OL>
 <LI><BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
		int ans = a;
		int i = 0;
		
		while(i != b){
		   i = i + 1;
		   ans = ans + 1;
		}
</PRE>
The above code computes the sum of a and b.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <LI><BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
		int ans = 1;
		int i = b;
		
		while (i != 0){
		   i = i-1;
		   ans = ans * a;
		}
</PRE>
The above code computes a to the power of b
</BLOCKQUOTE>

 <LI> <BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
		int ans = 0;
		int i =   a; 
		
		while (i >= b) { 
		   i   =   i - b;
		   ans = ans + 1;
		}
</PRE>
The above code computes a divided by b using integer arithmetic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>
<OL>
  <LI> Find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">Loop Invariants</a> of these three loops. Once you have found them, talk to the professor
  to make sure that they are correct.
  <LI> Sketch a mathematical proof to show that these loops actually return what we say that they return. You will not need to turn this in to the professor, 
  but it will be good practice for Part 2.
</OL>

<H4>Part 2</H4>

Consider the following code:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
		int power = 0;
		int i     = a;

		while (i%2 == 0) {  
  		   i = i/2;
		   power = power + 1;
		}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
  <LI> Create a table of values for a, i, and p for a couple of initial values of a. Use this table to find the relationship between a, i and p. 
  Hint: a is a function of i and p.
  <LI> This relationship is the Loop Invariant of this code. Write a mathematical proof that the loop invariant stays constant throughout the iterations.
  Every step must proceed from what came before it, with no gaps in logic.  Any flaw will cause your submission to be rejected, but you can continue revising
  your proof until the end of the semester when extensions are finally due.
  <LI> What does this relationship say about the natural numbers (your values of a)? The fact that this relationship is true for all numbers is 
  actually a mathematical theorem.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That theorem is used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test" target="primes">Miller&ndash;Rabin primality test</a>, which is a fast
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm" target="primes">probabilistic algorithm</a> for testing the primality of an integer:  
<UL>
<LI> If that test says <i>no</i>, then the
integer in question is definitely not prime.  
<LI> If that test says <i>yes</i>,
the the integer in question might be prime.  
</UL>The uncertainty can be reduced
arbitrarily by more testing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>


<H4>To Demo</H4>

You must 
<UL>
<LI> Show the loop invariants of all of the above loops
<LI> Have a mathematical proof for the correctness of the outcome of the final loop
<LI> Show your final work to the instructor with your name, your WUSTL key, and your student ID

<I>Disclaimer</I>:  
<UL>
<LI> The values computed in this assignment are based on
published formulas, but you are advised to undertake this and all forms of
exercise with the advice and consent of a physician.  
<LI>
In particular, performing
a one-rep max movement unprepared or unsupervised can result in injury.

You are therefore especially cautioned against that form of training without 
adequate supervision and coaching.
</UL>

The data computed by this exercise are for informational and instructional
purposes only.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Overview</H3>
In weight training, the volume of work completed in
one exercise (often called a <i>set</I>) is typically specified as a given weight that
is moved a specified number of times.  These are respectivelly
called the <I>weight</I> and <I>reps</I> (abbreviates repetitions)
of that set.
<p>
In this extension, you will create a one-rep max calculator. 
This calculator hypothetically calculates a weight that a subject
could move for one repetition, given that the same subject can successfully
complete <i>r</i> reps (in the range of
2&hellip;12) at a lighter weight.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>
Beyond 12&nbsp;reps,
the formula we use is not considered  accurate. 
<LI> The stated value for <i>r</I> is generally considered to be 
the number of times the weight
can be moved before <i>failure</I>:  the subject can complete <i>r</i> reps
at the stated weight, but no more.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
While a person may never attempt that one-rep max movement, the one-rep 
max weight is canonical, in that it can then be used to compute
lighter weights that should be feasible for the subject at a desired number
of reps.
<p>
Your solution will compute and print:
<UL>
  <LI> The one-rep max weight based on a formula described below.
  <LI> The weight that should be feasible for a stated number of reps.
  <LI> Percentages of the one-rep max weight from 95% to 50% in decrements
of 5%.
</UL>
<H3>Example</H3>
Consider a subject who can successfully
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press" target="reps">bench</a>
225&nbsp;pounds 10&nbsp;times before failure.   
<UL>
 <LI> What is this subjects current one-rep max bench weight?
 <LI> How much weight should that subject be able to bench to get 5 reps before failure?
 <LI> What percentage of this subject's max bench is the weight that can
be benched 5 times?

<H3>Procedure</H3>
<UL>
<LI> First take a look at 
<a href="http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax.html" target="reps">this one-rep max
caculator</a>.  
<UL>
<LI> If you try it for some sample values, you will see that it
produces results that may not work in an actual gym, because the smallest plate
one can find in most gyms is 2.5&nbsp;pounds.  

<LI>
Our calculator takes in a third input, which is how many reps the person 
wants to perform, 
and calculates a weight to be performed at that number of reps.
</UL>
<LI> 
Our 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum" target="reps">one-rep max</a>
calculations will be based on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum#Epley_Formula" target="reps">Epley Formula</a>,
so study that material sufficiently well to complete this extension.
<LI> Create a <KBD>OneRepMax</KBD> class in the <KBD>onerepmax</KBD> package
of the <KBD>extensions</KBD> folder.
<LI> Arrange for that program to prompt the user for the inputs needed for
this computation.
<LI> Compute and print the results as shown in the sample ouptut above for
the inputs provided in the run of your code.
<LI> You must:
<UL>
  <LI> Check that the inputs provided are reasonable. Print a suitable message and
exit if any inputs are unreasonable.
  <LI> Use iteration to produce the table of percentages of the one-rep max

<H3>Rock-paper-scissors</H3>
The game of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> (hereafter, <I>RPS</I>) is a two-player game that can be used to avoid boredom and to settle
disputes.
<p>
In this extension you will rewrite the lab from Module 2 in C++.
<H4>Procedure</H4>
<p>
Update your workspace as usual, and find the <KBD>Module 2</KBD> package
in the <KBD>extensions</KBD> source folder.  Create a new source file <KBD>rps</KBD> there,
and you are ready to begin your development.
<p>
It is suggested that you develop code
in small steps, so that you can proceed from confidence to confidence, and
not have a big pile of untested code to debug at the end.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To help motivate this approach, the TAs will not help you unless you have
shown progress based on these steps.   Ask for help as soon as you need it,
but please follow the steps below so that you can gain confidence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The steps you might consider are as follows:
<OL>
   <LI> What inputs does your program need?  First, get your program
to accept those inputs and print them out so you can see they are
set properly.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This means that you should type in the code to prompt the user for
the input(s), print out the values of those inputs, and that's all for now.
<B>Run your program</B> at this point and make sure it is behaving as you
want.
<p>
What inputs do you need?    There's no reason to ask for more than is
necessary.  At a minimum, you have to know how many rounds of RPS to play
before printing the resulting statistics.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> Next, create a loop that simply iterates the desired number of times.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Again, run your program.  You may want to print something out in your loop
so you can verify that the loop works correctly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> You next can make the concept of the random player <I>real</I>.
This means declaring a variable name of a suitable type to represent
this concept, establishing the variable's 
initial value.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What is the concept of the player?  There are many details about the player
that appear unnecessary:  the player's name, address, cell phone number.
<p>
On the other hand, if we are going to play RPS, we need to know what
move the player has made.  This is the important concept.
<p>
How do we represent the choice of rock, paper, or scissors?  This is left
up to you, so try for something simple.  It may help to recall how Paul
Revere was 
(<a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/PaulRevere%27sRide.html">poetically</a>)
told of how the British were coming:  one if by land, two if by sea.
<P>
In otherwords, an <KBD>int</KBD> encoded the manner of invasion.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If there were only two choices, why didn't Paul use a <KBD>boolean</KBD>?
Sadly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">Bool</a> was not yet born.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
   <LI> In your loop, you should modify this variable's value to reflect
the associated player choosing randomly 
among rock, paper, and scissors each iteration.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You've seen how to use the random number generator to pick between two
outcomes.  Now you must pick between three.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Run your program and verify that the player is choosing randomly.

<LI> OK, now for the other player.  This player must cycle among
rock, paper, and scissors.   Let's make this player real by declaring a
variable name of a suitable type and establishing its initial value.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the interest of consistency and simplicity, you should use the same
encoding for this player in terms of what value means rock, what value means
paper, what value means scissors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> In your loop, arrange for this player to choose its next move based on
its previous move.  If the move used to be rock, it's now paper.  If the move
used to be paper, it's now scissors.  If the move was scissors, it's now rock.
<LI> Run your program again and make sure the cycling player is behaving
properly.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To verify the cycling player's behavior, you will probably want to print out
the values representing that player's move each iteration.
<p>
It won't take many iterations to see if this is working or not:  10 should do.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Each player has made a move;  now let's see who won.   First,
pick a name, type, and initial value for the number of wins a player has.
Do the same for the other player.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Why do we need a variable to keep track of each player's wins?  Why not keep
track of only one player's wins and assume the other player won the other
rounds?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> In the loop, determine who won based on the current value of each
player's move.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#Game_play">rules</a> of RPS to adjudicate the winner, and credit
the win count properly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> After the loop completes, report the fraction of wins awarded to each
of the two players.
<LI> Test your code by trying it with just one iteration, two iterations, and
three iterations.  Make sure it's working before you set it loose.
<LI> Run your code several times, each on 1000 iterations.
<LI> Based on what you see, did one player tend to win more often than the other?
</OL>
