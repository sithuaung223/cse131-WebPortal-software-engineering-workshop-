<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>Example using graphics</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>GraphicsDemo</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises4</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
<LI> For each of the following, write code to generate the graphics as
specified, and run your program after each addition to see that you are
creating the right kinds of shapes, colors, and sizes.
<UL>
  <LI> Draw a blue point anywhere you like
  <LI> Draw a larger green point someplace else
  <LI> Draw an unfilled red triangle somewhere
  <LI> Draw a filled yellow circle somewhere
  <LI> Draw a filled blue rectangle somewhere
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The book does not include mention of Sedgewick's <KBD>filledRectangle</KBD> method.  But it is there, and you can find it by pausing after typing the <KBD>.</KBD>.  Eclipse will then show you possible completions, which will include
<KBD>filledRectangle</KBD>.

  <LI> Waits until the mouse has been pressed
  <LI> Waits until the mouse has been released
  <LI> Draws a visible point at the spot where the mouse was released

<H3>Follow the mouse</H3>
In this exercise you will apply what you have learned about graphics to
cause a ball to follow the mouse on a graphics screen.
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>MouseFollower</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises4</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
<LI> That code already contains the standard animation loop:
<UL>
  <LI> <KBD>StdDraw.clear()</kBD> at the beginning, to wipe the graphics
display clean
  <LI> Your code will then paint one frame of the animation
  <LI> <KBD>StdDraw.show(10)</KBD> produces what you have drawn on the screen
    and waits 10 milliseconds before continuing.   
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> By using <KBD>show(..)</KBD>,
the drawing you do is not actually shown between calls to <KBD>show</KBD>. 
<LI>
Instead, the drawing is done in memory, off the screen, which is much faster.
<LI> When you call <KBD>show()</KBD>, the work you have done off screen is put
on screen all at once. 
<LI> The program also pauses for the specified time, usually
10 to 50 milliseconds.  Pausing allows your computer to do something else
for a while, which will make your computer feel more responsive in the
other applications that are running.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<LI> First try to get a ball on the screen to follow your mouse.  This
consists of reading the mouse's coordinates, and painting a ball at that
spot.
<LI> When you have that working, try to think of how you could make the ball
appear to lag in its mouse-following activities.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> As a hint, think about
keeping some history of where the mouse has been.  
<LI> You can then have the
ball go to locations in the mouse's past.

<H3>Frequency of a pitch</H3>
As described in the videos and text, a musical pitch can be encoded
as an integer.  The convention for this course is that 0 corresponds to
concert A, 1 corresponds to Bb just above concert A, and so on.
<p>
In this exercise you will print out the frequency associated with 
a pitch, and with the pitch 7 chromatic steps above that pitch.
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>Pitches</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises4</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
<LI> Insert code to prompt the user to enter an integer representing a pitch.
<LI> Compute the frequency that corresponds to that pitch.
<LI> Print the frequency of that pitch, the frequency of a pitch 7 chromatic
steps higher, and the ratio of the two frequencies.
</UL>

<H3>Ratios of two pitches' frequencies</H3>
Continue your work on the above exercise as follows.
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Continue modifying the <KBD>Pitches</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises4</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
<LI> Prompt the user to enter an integer for pitch 1.
<LI> Prompt the user to enter an integer for pitch 2.
<LI> Compute the frequency that corresponds to those pitches
<LI> Print the frequency of both pitches
and the ratio of the two frequencies.
</UL>
