<HR>
<H2>TETRIS!</H2>
<p>
The game selected for this year's lab 10 is
<a href="http://www.freetetris.org/game.php/">tetris</a>.  You will
implement a simplified form of the game for this lab, but you are free to
do extra work for some extension credit. <br>
<br>
This is a good place to look to find information about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">pieces and scoring</a>. The requirements are listed below.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You may complete this lab as an individual or as a team of 2. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4> Basic Game</H4>
To receive credit for this lab, you must design and implement the following elements of the game:
<UL>
  <LI> <I>(7 points) </I>Create at least two different pieces (block configurations). Each piece should have a color associated with it.
<BLOCKQUOTE> <b>Note</b>: if one of the pieces you choose is the one with 4 blocks in a line, it must be in a vertical column in 
your implementation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
  <LI> <I>(8 points)</I> A score panel showing:
	<UL>
		<LI> Current score - Scoring does not have to adhere to Tetris rules of scoring but there must be a score per complete row.
		<LI> Next piece descending - Should be a picture not text
	</UL>
  <LI> <I>(15 points)</I> One piece descends at a time, a new piece appears when the current piece hits another piece or the bottom
  <LI> <I>(3 points)</I> Current piece is chosen at random
  <LI> <I>(15 points)</I> Pieces respond to key clicks that move them either left or right (rotation is not required)
  <LI> <I>(10 points)</I> Completed rows are removed and scored. A row is considered complete if it is filled with blocks with no spaces.
  <LI> <I>(10 points)</I> Pieces move down when a row(s) below is removed.
  <LI> <I>(2 points)</I> Cause your game to end when either the game display fills up or the player reaches some time or score threshold.  
  <LI> <b>Code requirement</b>:
    <UL>
      <LI>Graphical Objects you implement should implement the <KBD>Anim</KBD> interface.
      <LI>You are welcome to extend Anim for your own purposes.
    </UL>
</UL>

<H4>Grading</H4>
Lab 10 will be graded out of 100 points. Points are alloted as follows:
<UL>
  <LI> <B><I>2 points</I></B> <U>Studio</U> (4/7)
  <LI> <B><I>13 points</I></B> <U>Code Review</U>: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Deadline for the code review is Thursday, 4/21. If you plan on doing this on the last day you will be asked to sign up for a slot 
      in advance for that day. This part may be demoed during lab times, TA office hours, or instructor office hours.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI> You don't have to have everything done to have a code review but you should have a significant portion of your design and implementation done. Present the overview of your code structure. It's okay if you haven't fully implemented all specifications.
      <LI> Points are allocated as follows
	<UL>
	<LI> <I>(1 point)</I>List all classes
	<LI> <I>(5 points)</I>For each class have a file and in comments at the top of the file specify the following:
	  <UL>
	    <LI> has-a's (what information/state will the instance variables represent)
	    <LI> functionality, how will you access and manipulate the has-a's (what methods will you have)
	  </UL>
       <LI> <I>(4 points)</I>Explain the relationship between the classes, how they are used to implement the game
       <LI> <I>(3 points)</I>This is a reasonable design for the problem
       <LI> <I>(-10 points)</I>If you cannot demonstrate that this is your original design and all team members have participated
	</UL>
    </UL>
  <LI>
  <LI> <B><I>70 points</I></B> <U>Completion of Basic Game requirements</U>. Points will be allotted for each feature successfully implemented
    as specified in the Basic Game section above. 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      You will need to sign up in advance for a slot on 4/26 or 4/28 to demo your game. A form is in the works for you to do this. 
      You will not be able to demo this part at TA office hours.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> <B><I>10 points</I></B> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming"><U>code modularity</U></a> and <U>generalization</U>
    <UL> 
      <LI> Did you implement and design reusable, self-contained pieces of code as Objects and Methods?
      <LI> If you used some piece of code over and over did you put it in a method? 
      <LI> Did you use Array, Lists and Sets where appropriate instead of creating a lot of individual variables?
      <LI> The majority of the functionality of your code should be in your Objects not in your <b>main</b> method.
    </UL>
  <LI> <B><I>5 points</I></B> <U>cosmetic style</U>: indentation and comments
  <LI> <B><I>-25 points</I></B> Used a concept outside of the scope of the class and could not explain it.
</UL>

<H4> Lab10 Regrade Policy</H4>
<BlOCKQUOTE>
          Since you will be present for grading, if you want a regrade you have to ask for it at the time of your demoing. I will not be accepting regrade requests after your demo time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4> Extra Credit (extension points)</H4>
See the <a href="extensions.html" target="new">extension</a> activities published for the game module.  Check back
in case some new ones are added.
<h4> Contest! </H4>
We will hold a contest of those worthy entries that are demo'ed and submitted
on time.  To be worthy:
<UL>
  <LI> Your entry must be received on-time, not late
  <LI> You must have committed all code, images, and sound in your repo by
the on-time demo date.
  <LI> You must have completed at least 10 extension points for the game
  <LI> You must convince a TA (who signs off on your demo) that your game
is award-worthy
</UL>
Winner(s) will be decided by the TAs and prizes will be awarded to the
winning group(s).
<HR>

<H3>How do I process keyboard input?</H3>
Please use the following keys for your game, 
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
<TR> <TH> Key</TH> <TH> Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR> <TD> A or a </TD> <TD> Left</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD> D or d </TD> <TD> Right</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<p>
The methods of use to you from Sedgewick's API:
<DL>
<DT> <KBD> boolean StdDraw.hasNextKeyType()</KBD>
<DD> You can call this method to see if the player has typed any key.  It does not
wait for input.
<DT> <KBD> char StdDraw.nextKeyTyped()</KBD>
<DD> This method returns the next key typed.  You should only call this method
if the above method has returned <KBD>true</KBD>.

<HR>
<H2>Submitting your work (read carefully)</H2>
<UL>
<LI> You must commit all of your work to your repository.  It's best to do this
from the top-most level of your repository, which bears your name and student ID.
<LI> You must demo the commited work to a TA.  Make sure the TA knows that
your demo is for credit at this point.  
<LI> Follow the directions below to have your demo for this work recorded.
</UL>
