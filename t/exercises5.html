<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>Cooking abstractions</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>Recipe</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises5</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> For the work below, enter your work into that file.
</UL>
In the introductory video for this exercise, you heard the
following recipe excerpt:
<UL>
<LI> Heat 200 cc water to 100 degrees
<LI> Stir in 5 grams of yeast
<LI> Melt butter and stur in the vanilla with the butter
<LI> After 5 minutes, combine yeast with butter, sugar, and flour
<LI> Place the mixture in a 110 degree oven to rise for 45 minutes
<LI> Divide the mixture into 10 equally sized portions and cook for
45 minutes at 350 degrees
</UL>
Define abstractions present in the above recipe.  Rephrase the
recipe in terms of your abstractions.

<H3>Exercises:  writing methods</H3>
<H4>Instructions</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Find and open the <KBD>StringMethods</KBD> Java program in the <KBD>exercises5</KBD> package
  of the <KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder.
  <LI> Write the methods described below into the program.
  <LI> Call those methods from the <KBD>main</KBD> method and print out the
    results to check that your work is correct.
  <LI> The first method is completed for you already.
</UL>
The methods you should write:
<UL>
  <LI> A method that takes in a <KBD>String</KBD> and returns that string
     concatenated with itself.  <EM>This one is completed for you.</EM>
 <LI> A method that takes in a <KBD>String</KBD> and an <KBD>int</KBD> <EM>n</EM>, and returns <EM>n</EM> cpies of the string concatenated together
  <LI> Now go back and rewrite your first method by having it call the second
one.
  <LI> Take a look at Java's <KBD><a href="">split</a></KBD> method, that
splits a <KBD>String</KBD> into an array containing the parts split by the
specified regular expression.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, assume the regular expression is simply <KBD>" "</KBD>, so that the
input <KBD>String</KBD> is split into words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> Write a method <KBD>join(String[] array, String joiner)</KBD> that
is the inverse of split: it returns a single <KBD>String</KBD> with a copy
of the <KBD>joiner</KBD> string between each part.
  <LI> Rewrite your second method in terms of this last one.  To do this,
create an array that has <EM>n</EM> copies of a given <KBD>String</KBD>, and
then use your <KBD>join</KBD> method to concatenate them.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Think about the string you want to appear between the copies, so that
it appears the strings were concontenated together as before.
