<H3>Exercises</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These exercises are part of the asynchronous component of this course.
Material is taught and demonstrated, but at times you are asked to complete
one of the exercises to help you master the new concepts.
<p>
In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<KBD>exercises</KBD> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the asynchronous material,
spend some time on the exercise.  When you are finished, commit your code
so that credit for the exercise can be given.
<p>
It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.

<H3>A static and interative <KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method</H3>
<OL>
<LI> In the <KBD>exercises9</KBD> package of your <KBD>exercises</KBD> folder,
open the <KBD>ListNode</KBD> class.
<LI> You will find there a <I>stub</I> method for
<KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
 <LI> A stub is the starting sketch of a method.  It usually returns some
default result, which, while not correct, is a starting point for developing
a real implementation of the method.
 <LI> Because this method is <KBD>static</KBD>, it does not have access to
the class parameter type <KBD>T</KBD>.  Thus you see that the method
declaration:
<PRE>
public static&lt;T&gt; int size(ListNode&lt;T&gt; start)
</PRE>
declares the type parameter <KBD>T</KBD> on the <KBD>static</KBD> attribute.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <LI> Complete the method so that it computes the size of a sequence of
<KBD>ListNode&lt;T&gt;</KBD> objects, where the list is implied to begin at the
parameter <KBD>start</KBD>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You must use <B>iteration</B>, not recursion, for your solution.  
You can review the video with the
students in which they worked on a recursive solution.  But your solution
here must be iterative.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> To test your code, uncomment the lines of code in the <KBD>main</KBD>
method that call the <KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method.
</OL>
If you get stuck, take a look at the solution video but look only as far
as you must to get unstuck.  At that point, resume work on your own.

<H3>A static and recursive <KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method</H3>
In this exercise, you continue your work from the previous exercise.
<OL>
<LI> In the <KBD>exercises9</KBD> package of your <KBD>exercises</KBD> folder,
open the <KBD>ListNode</KBD> class, which should contain your work from
the previous exercise.
<LI> Rename the existing <KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method to some
other name (such as <KBD>sizeIterative</KBD>, and define a new 
<KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method for your work here.
 <LI> Complete the method so that it computes the size of a sequence of
<KBD>ListNode</KBD> objects, where the list is implied to begin at the
parameter <KBD>start</KBD>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI> Here you must use recursion for your solution.
<LI> The interactive student video does exactly that, so you can review it
if necessary.  However, try to do this on your own as much as possible.
<LI> The solution for this exercise contains another video showing how to
solve this problem.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI> To test your code, use the lines of code in the <KBD>main</KBD>
method that call the <KBD>size(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method.
</OL>
If you get stuck, take a look at the solution videos but look only as far
as you must to get unstuck.  At that point, resume work on your own.

<H3>A static and recursive <KBD>sum(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method</H3>
In this exercise, you continue your work from the previous exercise.
<OL>
<LI> In the <KBD>exercises9</KBD> package of your <KBD>exercises</KBD> folder,
open the <KBD>ListNode</KBD> class, which should contain your work from
the previous exercises.
<LI> Define a method stub by inserting the following code into your class:
<PRE>
	//
	// static and iterative
	//
	public static&lt;T&gt; int sum(ListNode&lt;T&gt; start) {
		// NB  start could be null!
		return 0; // FIXME
	}
</PRE>
 <LI> Complete the method so that it computes the sum of a sequence of
<KBD>ListNode</KBD> objects's values, where the list is implied to begin at the
parameter <KBD>start</KBD>.
  <LI> To test your code, use the lines of code in the <KBD>main</KBD>
method that call the <KBD>sum(ListNode&lt;T&gt;)</KBD> method.
</OL>
If you get stuck, take a look at the solution videos but look only as far
as you must to get unstuck.  At that point, resume work on your own.
