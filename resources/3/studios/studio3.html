If necessary,
review <a href="../../StudioDocs/studioheader.html">studio procedures</a> before
starting.
<HR>
<H3>Warmup</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
First, form a group:
<UL>
 <LI> If you are at a table with a large, wall-mounted screens, a group of 3-4 people is fine.
 <LI> If you are seated at a table without a large screen, a group of 2 people is better.
</UL>
<LI> All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along
and see the instructions as you work.
<LI> All members of the group should update their repositories:
<UL>
  <LI> Open your repository in eclipse
  <LI> Right-click (control-click on a mac) on your repository name
  <LI> Drag down to <KBD>Team...</KBD>
  <LI> Choose <KBD>Update</KBD>
  <LI> Supply your WUSTL key and password as necessary
</UL>
<LI> Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work.  Initially,
one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
<LI> Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.  Before doing so,
<B>commit your work</B> to make sure your work is saved.
</UL>

<HR>
<H3> Dice Simulation</H3> 
<p>
In this studio you will simulate the throw of a number of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice">Dice</a>.
This will require using what you have learned in
<a href="../2/">Module 2</a> and <a href="../1/">Module 1</a> but will
also require the use of <I>arrays</I> as taught in <a href="./">this module</a>.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We ask that you follow these instructions carefully, step-by-step, so as to
develop your code by concept refinement.   Each concept is first described,
and then your group takes steps to implement the concept.
<p>
Ask questions as needed to complete one step before going on to the next.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Procedure</H4>
In the steps described below, pictures are shown of dice to illustrate
the concepts involved in this studio.  You will not really be using or
displaying the pictures.  Instead, your program will <I>simulate</I> throwing
dice and you will measure the properties of interest.
<OL>
  <LI> You need two pieces of information from the user:
<DL>
   <DT> How many dice will be used in this simulation?
<DD>
For the purposes of this document, let us say that <I>D</I> dice are used.
<p>
As an example, if <I>D</I> is <KBD>3</KBD>, then a given throw could
be:
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40">
<IMG SRC=Studio/5.jpg WIDTH="40">
<IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40">
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
   <DT> How many times will the dice be thrown?
<DD>
For the purposes of this document, let us say that the dice will be thrown
<I>T</I> times.
<p>
As an example, if <I>T</I> is <KBD>5</KBD>, then the dice could be thrown
as follows:
<a name="fig1"></a>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR> <TH COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER> Figure 1 </TH> </TR>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</DL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At this point, 
<UL>
<LI> Create a class <KBD>Dice</KBD> in the <KBD>studio3</KBD>
package (which is in the <KBD>studios</KBD> source folder).  
<LI> Decide on meaningful variable names for the concepts introduced so far:
<UL>
  <LI> The number of dice used in this simulation.
  <LI> The number of times the dice are thrown.
</UL>
<LI> Insert code
to obtain the values for these variables from the user.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have forgotten how to do this, look at examples from previous studios
or look at the code from lecture.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Test your code at this point, printing out the values you have received.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Now let's simulate the dice rolls.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the purposes of this lab, let's say that each die is six-sided, and
therefore labeled to show the values 1&hellip;6.  If you have time, you
might consider how to change your code to accommodate dice that have fewer or
more than 6 sides.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You need to iterate, assigning each
die's roll the value that it shows in your simulated roll.
Pseudocode for this activity is shown below:
<PRE>
// Pseudocode
// for each die d
//     randomly throw d to obtain the value v, shown face-up on d
// end
</PRE>
<DL>
<DT>
How should you represent the value <I>v</I> shown on the die?  
<DD>
Talk this over as a group.
While it is true that in computer science most sequences start at 0, you should
pick a representation that helps you solve the problem at hand.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Spoilers: You will need to sum the values shown on the dice.</B>  You should
therefore pick a representation that makes this easy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT> How will you compute (by simulation) the value <I>v</I> for each die <I>d</I>'s roll?
<DD>
You have seen this before:  use some simple computation based on <KBD>Math.random()</KBD> to compute a value in your representation of choice for each die's
roll.
</DL>
<LI> 
You next need a mechanism for remembering the value of each die as it is thrown.
<p>
Consider the example shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.  After the
first throw, we have:
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40">
<IMG SRC=Studio/5.jpg WIDTH="40">
<IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40">
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
You must provision an array with one slot per die to hold the results of
each throw.   
If <I>D</I> is the number of dice, then
such an array might fit into your program as follows:
<PRE>
int[] diceThrown = new int[D]
// for each die d
//     randomly throw d to obtain the value v, shown face-up on d
//     record die d's role in the diceThrown array
// end
// At this point, your dieThrown array has an entry that shows each die's value
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Review the material we have been studying on <B>arrays</B>, and discuss as a group
how to deply the above array to remember each die's value after it has been thrown.
Instantiate the array in your code and make sure its size is exactly
right for the task at hand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For the example above,
your array might look like:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
<TR> <TH> array index </TH> <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 0 </TD> <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 1</TD> <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 2 </TD> </TR>
<TR> <TH> array contents </TH> <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 3 </TD> <TD ALIGN=CENTER>5</TD> <TD ALIGN=CENTER>3</TD></TR>
<TR> <TH> represents </TH> 
<TD> <IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40"> </TD>
<TD> <IMG SRC=Studio/5.jpg WIDTH="40"> </TD>
<TD> <IMG SRC=Studio/3.jpg WIDTH="40"> </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<p>
<LI> Insert code to print th array's values, and run your program several
times to make sure the values look reasonable.
<HR>
<LI> Around the code you have currently programmed, insert a loop so that
your code iterates <I>T</I> times.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Recall <I>T</I> was a value prompted from the user.  It is the number of
times we will throw the dice.
<p>
You do <B>not</B> need a different or larger array than the one you already
have.  You only need to remember the dice values after each throw.  You will
not be required to remember the values from <I>all</I> of the throws.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Run your program and examine the values printed from the <I>T</I> iterations.  They should continue to look reasonable (albeit random).
<HR>
<LI> Suppose we are interested in how often all of the dice show the same
value after they are thrown within one of the <I>T</I> iterations.
In the example shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, this happened 1 in 5
times (so, 20% or 0.2).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What are the steps needed to make a concept real?    Some related questions are:
<UL>
  <LI> How can we determine if all dice have the same value after they are thrown?
Fortunately, you have stored the dice values so they can be examined after they have all been thrown.
  <LI> How do we keep track of the number of times they all have the same value?
  <LI> How do we report the fraction of times they all have the same value?
</UL>
<p>
Take those steps now
so that your code can determine when all of the dice values are the same.
Arrange for your program to print out the fraction or percentage of times the
throws result in the same value for all dice.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<LI> Suppose we are next are interested in the <I>sum</I> of the dice values.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Make this concept real taking the usual steps.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Arrange for your program to print out the dice values' sum each time
the dice are thrown.  In addition to any output you already produce, you
should have <I>T</I> more lines of output, one for each iteration of
throwing the dice.  
<p>
Make sure the results seem reasonable.
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you get this far, that is great, and we will demo you and consider your work done.
If you have time now, or inclination later, take a look at the rest and see if you can do it.
<p>
This will help prepare you for the exam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Suppose we are interested in how often each possible sum occurs as the
dice are thrown.
In the example in <a href="#fig1">Figure&nbsp;1</a>, the sums
were seen as follows:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER PADDING=5>
<TR> <TH> Sum</TH> <TH> Number of times<br>Sum was seen </TH></TR>
<TR> 
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 7</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 1</TD>
</TR>
<TR> 
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 8</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 2</TD>
</TR>
<TR> 
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER>11</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 1</TD>
</TR>
<TR> 
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER>18</TD>
  <TD ALIGN=CENTER> 1</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To make this concept real, have the following discussion:
<UL>
  <LI> What values could the sum possibly take, given that there are <I>D</I> dice?
  <LI> Based on what we have studied thus far, kind and type of variable is needed to keep track of the sums?
  <LI> Where in your code should you update how often a sum occurs?
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> Arrange for your program to produce output (formatted as you like) that
shows how often each sum occurs as a fraction or percentage of all of the
throws.  It's OK to report <KBD>0</KBD> for sums whose values did not occur.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For <I>D</I> dice, which sums occur most frequently?  You can determine this
by running your program on different numbers of dice, but using enough iterations
to show typical behavior.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
